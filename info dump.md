This file is a dump of information I could find about Cicada 3301.
Some things may be wrong, this is only a archive to prevent information loss over time.

## An original /sci/ thread
It dates back to Jan. 8 2012 - Jan. 11 2012

URL : https://warosu.org/sci/thread/4229423

Backup : see '2012 thread.png'

The thread also contains a copy of the timer for 845145127.com :
(Contrary to what's often shown on documentaries about 3301, the countdown is in Red. This is confirmed by a very-low resolution picture seen in the archived thread)
```
<html><head><title>845145127</title><style>body{background-color:#ffff
ff;text-align: center;}</style></head>
<body><img src="/cicada.jpg" title="Patience is a virtue." /><br />
<span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans; font-size: 130%;">

BackColor = "white";
ForeColor = "red";
CountActive = true;
CountStepper = -1;
LeadingZero = true;
DisplayFormat = "%%D%% Days, %%H%% Hours, %%M%% Minutes, %%S%% Seconds.";
FinishMessage = "Reload this page.";
</script>

</body></html>
```

Some anons also report that the 845145127.com server had other ports open : FTP, SSH (and "a XMPP client" and "S2S servers")
The fact that a FTP server existed is confirmed by a recap pastebin from that time : https://pastebin.com/q4s2Jkfe (also found in that thread)
