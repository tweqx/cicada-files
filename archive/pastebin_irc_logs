[03:49] <Anon7> this is the off-topic channel
[03:49] <wind> Nothing makes me think that, I was told that this IRC is my spot though.
[03:49] <wind> I wanted /x/, it's more fun to read.
[03:50] <dull_netbk> well
[03:50] <dull_netbk> tbh if you think all the progress is made publicly, kinda makes you childish
[03:51] <wind> Ahha, darling I don't think you realize what I'm talking about.
[03:51] <dull_netbk> mmhm
[03:52] <dull_netbk> so join the real channels then.
[03:52] <dull_netbk> or join the military
[03:52] <Anon7> I think this faggot is a troll.
[03:52] <dull_netbk> be what you can be
[03:52] <dull_netbk> definite troll
[03:53] <wind> Call me what you like, I already gave out the pieces I was told, so now I'm basically just here to monitor and chat.
[03:53] <wind> Also hon, faggot is the wrong term for woman.
[03:53] <dull_netbk> actually hon, faggot = gay and gay doesnt discriminate sexes
[03:54] <dull_netbk> women are gay too hon

[03:54] <Anon7> Oh look
[03:54] <Anon7> it has GOTIS.
[03:55] <wind> Gay, is referring to males, Lesbian is referring to females.
[03:55] <dull_netbk> looks like it
[03:55] <dull_netbk> hahahah yeah right
[03:55] <dull_netbk> read a book
[03:55] <wind> If we want to use literally definitions here, Faggot means pile of sticks, or a Euro cigarette.  
[03:56] <dull_netbk> Euro cigarette?
[03:56] <dull_netbk> "look at me, i´m a girl"
[03:56] <wind> I believe the word that you are thinking of that defines both sexes as homosexual, or slang word for that matter, is "homo"
[03:56] <wind> Although that lost popularity around 4 years ago.
[03:56] <dull_netbk> and I believe in flying spaghetti monster
[03:57] <dull_netbk> doesnt mean that it´s real tho
[03:57] <dull_netbk> sooooooo umm.
[03:57] <wind> You believe that 3301 is a group, so um?
[03:57] <dull_netbk> anyone hungry=
[03:57] <dull_netbk> group?
[03:57] <wind> If whoever finds it first releases it to the public, you'll be amazed.
[03:57] <dull_netbk> like, a band?
[03:57] <wind> Otherwise you'll dwell in the possibilities.
[03:58] <wind> And by group I was meaning, clan, or legion, or whatever terminology you prefer.
[03:58] <dull_netbk> so you´re in the military?
[03:58] <Anon7> lol
[03:58] <dull_netbk> no wonder you can be a girl in the internet
[03:58] <wind> We have no military (:
[03:58] <dull_netbk> "be all you can be" "so i became a girl in the internet"

[04:01] <Idonteven> Wind, lemme give you an update... We are getting tired of the charade and have hit a wall of which there is no overcoming.
[04:01] <wind> Great, this IRC got x3 more boring then.
[04:01] <wind> I'm not even sure if any of you even sent a status1 email.
[04:01] <Anon7> wind, you're in the wrong channel fucktard
[04:02] <Idonteven> So did we decide if he is actually part of "3301"?

[04:03] <wind> I gave my last away.
[04:03] <wind> On ALL the IRC's
[04:03] <wind> about this.
[04:03] <Idonteven> So what is the status on the 3301 project?
[04:03] <wind> So now I'm just here to talk.
[04:04] <wind> Until I'm sent for shifts.
[04:04] <Idonteven> Wonderful.
[04:04] <dull_netbk> i can live with that tho.
[04:04] <Idonteven> Could you describe a shift please?
[04:04] <Idonteven> It is unclear exactly what you do
[04:04] <wind> A very brief summary, a shift is driving for hellish hours to check QR codes.

[04:07] <Idonteven> Believe me, the few of us who have been dedicated to this for the past 4 days are quite persistent. However, as it has also interfered with my much needed studying and social life, I have grown old of this charade.
[04:07] <wind> To be completely honest, I doubt if anyone here will get the clues sorted, status1 email sender or not.
[04:07] <wind> It's complicated, and that was our goal.
[04:07] <Idonteven> I'll give you that.
[04:07] <Idonteven> It is QUITE complicated.
[04:08] <wind> Only a select few, not many, if we made it any easier, MANY would get it.
[04:08] <kristen> wind why are you talking like you own 3301
[04:08] <Idonteven> Could you describe what you mean by "highly intelligent"? Because as far as I can tell your definition is being able to crack codes fast and decipher things.
[04:08] <wind> Well think of it as a company.
[04:08] <wind> Shareholders take shares in the company, and technically own it.
[04:09] <wind> So in part, I do.
[04:09] <wind> Along with others.
[04:09] <Anon7> It's a marketing company right?

[04:09] <wind> It was an example.
[04:09] <Idonteven> Could you describe what you mean by "highly intelligent"?
[04:09] <wind> And Idonteven, you can solve it all without cracking codes and using programs, there's other clues hidden.
[04:09] <kristen> wind do you own a volvo?
[04:09] <wind> But they're harder.

[04:11] <Idonteven> Your friend who goes by the name Mahashi (I believe that was his or her name), said there were 5 of you
[04:11] * killuminati slaps kristen around a bit with a large fishbot
[04:11] <kristen> well we think you guys are associated with volvo
[04:11] <Idonteven> He was quite an annoying one if I may add, you are much more pleasant.
[04:11] <dull_netbk> wind okay a serious question: how many "win"´s are there?
[04:11] <kristen> idk what could be much better than a volvo
[04:11] <wind> That would be about correct when he was on, we may have gotten one more, I'm not sure yet I haven't talked to the others.
[04:12] <Idonteven> Is it a status1 email recipient?

[04:12] <dull_netbk> wind correct
[04:12] <wind> Each of our names signify something, there's an extra hint.
[04:12] <wind> If you didn't already catch that.
[04:12] <wind> Only 2 of us monitor IRC.
[04:12] <Idonteven> Well
[04:12] <wind> Me and mahi
[04:12] <kristen> ...wat
[04:12] <Idonteven> we have chatted about a LOT of stuff.
[04:13] <Idonteven> mahi is some indian town or something
[04:13] <Idonteven> we found nothing relevant in that unfortunately
[04:13] <benjy3301> What do the other 3 do?
[04:13] <wind> Shifts, and clue planning.
[04:13] <wind> And other jobs
[04:13] <wind> We really don't start anything serious until someone solves the clues.
[04:13] <Idonteven> Was this entire story line laid out before you sent out the first image?
[04:14] <wind> To be honest? Almost every possibility was worked out.
[04:14] <Idonteven> That is pretty amazing.
[04:14] <Idonteven> I give props to every single one of you.
[04:14] <wind> Even the absurd ones, like someone solving it the second we post.
[04:14] <wind> Which I thought was funny.

[04:15] <kristen> wind why didnt you put anything in nj :(
[04:15] <Idonteven> My question is, if you don't have to crack codes to solve it, then how do you find the answer? Like where would I be able to type it in. For example: the email .onion site, if we couldn't crack that then how could you solve this?
[04:16] <wind> That actually isn't in our hands, it depends when certain clues are uncovered / progressed on.

[04:23] <kristen> its not insight information, its a placebo effect to make you think youre getting answers
[04:23] <Idonteven> I forget exactly what happened, I haven't gotten much sleep the past few days.
[04:23] <benjy3301> Put the picture in Outguess to get poems.
[04:23] <kristen> laughinggirls.jpg
[04:23] <Idonteven> OK.
[04:23] <Idonteven> Still couldn't care.
[04:23] <dull_netbk> wind by "most" you mean "more"?
[04:23] <wind> No, I meant most.
[04:24] <wind> Most people who found the codes, would take pictures.
[04:24] <dull_netbk> that´s a harsh assumption
[04:24] <wind> We debated whether they would rip them off or not, and we figured that they'd take pictures.
[04:24] <wind> I think someone even left a camera at one spot.
[04:24] <Idonteven> I think we ripped a few off.
[04:25] <Idonteven> the chino one was reportedly never there.
[04:25] <dull_netbk> wind oh you meaned "take pictures instead ripping it off"
[04:25] <MIA> the Miami one wasn't there in the early afternoon, it didn't show up till later
[04:25] <Idonteven> May I ask how exactly you became a part of this group, wind?
[04:25] <wind> Please don't correct me, if I see a major fault in what I wrote I'll fix it myself, Thank you.
[04:25] <andrewarmada> hi wind
[04:26] == __ [6352f874@n0v4-D76D1C4A.lightspeed.stlsmo.sbcglobal.net] has quit [Ping timeout]
[04:26] <dull_netbk> wind it was more of a question
[04:26] <wind> I was an original of the 5, along with the others.
[04:26] <kristen> LOL
[04:26] <Idonteven> Wut.jpg
[04:26] * kristen likes slapping people and randomly picks wind to slap.
[04:26] <MIA> so why'd you set all this up?
[04:26] <Idonteven> LOL
[04:27] <wind> You'll find out at the end.
[04:27] <dull_netbk> wind b/c anticipating that most ppl take pictures of your poster is kinda retarded, most ppl don´t give a shit
[04:27] <Idonteven> Is that why we took pictures?
[04:27] <Idonteven> ^.^
[04:27] <wind> ^
[04:27] <Idonteven> cuz we dungiveshit
[04:27] <MIA> how many people e-mailed?
[04:27] <andrewarmada> wow i feel like i missed a lot
[04:28] <andrewarmada> and only gone for what?? an hour max?
[04:28] <wind> I'm unsure, I'm not monitoring that.
[04:28] <MIA> yeah, I don't really know what's going on, just showed up after a day or so
[04:28] <Idonteven> Nah, you didn't miss much
[04:28] <dull_netbk> considering how much ppl is living on earth, i say most ppl didnt give ashit
[04:28] <Idonteven> So is it safe to assume that only a few will get the email, and everyone else will be left in the dark. No explanation whatsoever?
[04:28] <Idonteven> Because I will be extremely sad.
[04:28] <kristen> did you think people NOT on the internet would see the pictures and be like OH WOW SO COOL IM GONNA GO ON THE INTERNET
[04:29] <dull_netbk> kristen my point exactly
[04:29] <Idonteven> The QR codes weren't really meant for random people walking along the road. They were purposefully meant for the people who received the first image online.
[04:30] <Idonteven> Nobody else would have the drive to complete this.
[04:30] <andrewarmada> wind, how did you get started into doing this? like did u guys get together and were like "lets make a world wide ARP"
[04:30] <benjy3301> ^
[04:30] <dull_netbk> targetting the campaign (w/e) for 7 billion ppl and turning up with about 4-5 pics is kind of a fail
[04:30] <wind> I can't divulge that either, but no to the part in quotations.
[04:30] <Idonteven> It is not targeted for 7 billion people.
[04:31] <dull_netbk> idonteven that´s what wind was saying, kind of
[04:31] <andrewarmada> lol.. cause i was really interested..
[04:31] <Idonteven> Hardly
[04:31] <Idonteven> So is it safe to assume that only a few will get the email, and everyone else will be left in the dark. No explanation whatsoever?
[04:31] <dull_netbk> i asked him to clarify, no reply
[04:31] <andrewarmada> we will get the end explanation
[04:31] <wind> We already listed an explanation for who were choosing, so if you're not chosen you'll know why.
[04:31] <MIA> it's interesting that some of the people that solved the first parts didn't get the last ones for various reasons and so are left out
[04:31] <andrewarmada> but the first who get it will get the "prize" and every1 else will have to wait
[04:31] <Idonteven> which is like "sorry, you were not excepted."
[04:32] <dull_netbk> "We anticipated most people would post pictures though."
[04:32] <Idonteven> So basically, this will remain completely secret to every single person in this room.
[04:32] <andrewarmada> until an email leaks
[04:32] <benjy3301> They're looking for individuals.
[04:32] <Idonteven> Which is most likely won't, or that person's "prize" will be terminated.
[04:32] <MIA> because eventually a bunch of people just emailed because they waited in this irc and didn't contribute
[04:32] <kristen> [22:31] <wind> We already listed an explanation for who were choosing, so if you're not chosen you'll know why.
[04:32] <kristen> what explanation?
[04:33] <MIA> as a result, it would be really difficult to pick a person to choose
[04:33] <andrewarmada> they dont want the followers
[04:33] <wind> Highly intelligent individuals will be chosen.
[04:33] <benjy3301> They're looking for individuals.
[04:33] <Idonteven> "Highly intelligent people... First come first serve, no exceptions"
[04:33] <kristen> oic
[04:33] <wind> If you are not chosen, you are not highly intelligent.
[04:33] <andrewarmada> ouch
[04:33] <kristen> ouch
[04:33] <kristen> lol
[04:33] <MIA> particularly since you can't match up the e-mails to the people solving things
[04:33] * andrewarmada goes and dies
[04:33] <andrewarmada> i gotta go..
[04:33] <traube> <wind> If you are not chosen, you are not highly intelligent.
[04:33] <traube> lol
[04:33] <andrewarmada> some1 post some of the logs..
[04:33] <benjy3301> o.o
[04:33] <Idonteven> I was in a class when we discovered the tor. Most of us were. A lot of people got shafted and a lot of followers got the email out first
[04:34] <kristen> too bad you were too dumb to skip class
[04:34] <wind> You assume we didn't think of that, trust me, it will all play out.
[04:34] <MIA> yeah, I'm in the same boat, solving the original stuff with davidson and all then having to leave and coming back to a bunch of spamming
[04:34] <Idonteven> It is finals week for me
[04:34] <Idonteven> Can't skip it lol
[04:34] <kristen> you can do anything you want
[04:34] <kristen> wind how are you going to solve that then?
[04:34] <kristen> curious to know
[04:34] <Idonteven> Alright wind, I trust you for the most part.
[04:34] <andrewarmada> well thanks wind.. for chatting with us and clearing stuff up.. but remember with every answer u give 5 more are expected
[04:35] <andrewarmada> and i really got to go. its really late over here and i would love to fail my exams tomorrow to chat w/ u guys.. but my parents wouldnt approve
[04:35] <Idonteven> Actually, every question asked has been seperated in relationship. Except for most of kristen's.
[04:35] <andrewarmada> so yeah good night.
[04:35] <Idonteven> Night man
[04:35] <Idonteven> It was a pleasure.

	[06:50] <Artemis> obv i didnt
[06:50] <Artemis> but i did want a port scan, nmap -p-
[06:50] <Artemis> and 33011 was open
[06:51] <Artemis> so i netcat'd
[06:51] <Artemis> it printed text
[06:51] <Artemis> here http://pastebin.com/r7v26XMG
[06:51] <Artemis> then i thought
[06:51] <Artemis> what the hell?
[06:51] <Artemis> so I tried nap -sV on port 33011
[06:51] <Artemis> and it was closed.
[06:51] <MIA> hmm
[06:51] <TooMuchBrood> cool story bro
[06:51] <batlord> what exactly lead you to netcat it in the first place?
[06:52] <Artemis> and i thought of agrippa
[06:52] <Artemis> erasing itself
[06:52] <MIA> the eve of thor
[06:52] <MIA> s day?
[06:52] <MIA> lol
[06:52] <Artemis> netcat? honestly my big bro suggested it
[06:52] <MIA> so wednesday?
[06:52] <batlord> cause we might've skipped a few steps getting to this
[06:53] <dest> that's weird
[06:53] <dest> netcat should've been mentioned in some lead then

[06:53] <benjy3301> Oi artemis.

[06:54] <Artemis> ya benjy3301?
[06:54] <MIA> that's why I don't bother with using any internet subscription at all
[06:54] <benjy3301> Enter the tscgyfy2m36cs4ec in tor with .onion on the end.
[06:54] <benjy3301> It then says this.
[06:54] <benjy3301> You have come far, far indeed. We warned you not to share once. We will not warn you again.  This Quest needs a smaller party.  Too late. No more spreading. Good luck.

[06:49] <MIA> damnit, no email
[06:50] <caca> What is the "new development" anon
[06:50] <TooMuchBrood> ill send you an email
[06:50] <Artemis> okay no one hurt me but i wanted to see if i could break into when it went up
[06:50] <Artemis> obv i didnt
[06:50] <Artemis> but i did want a port scan, nmap -p-
[06:50] <Artemis> and 33011 was open
[06:51] <Artemis> so i netcat'd
[06:51] <Artemis> it printed text
[06:51] <Artemis> here http://pastebin.com/r7v26XMG
[06:51] <Artemis> then i thought
[06:51] <Artemis> what the hell?
[06:51] <Artemis> so I tried nap -sV on port 33011
[06:51] <Artemis> and it was closed.
[06:51] <MIA> hmm
[06:51] <TooMuchBrood> cool story bro
[06:51] <batlord> what exactly lead you to netcat it in the first place?
[06:52] <Artemis> and i thought of agrippa

[06:52] <MIA> lol
[06:52] <Artemis> netcat? honestly my big bro suggested it

[08:49] <cryptopuzzle> there is no email, it's a deadend to filter those who wait and those who keep looking
[08:49] <fg> email was just link to second onion page, that is down now
[08:49] <fg> if it exists at all
[08:50] <FindUs> then why would they lie on the first onion page?
[08:50] <FindUs> saying they will give everyone a different number to add after the slash?
[08:51] <vtlxx> i wouldnt dohbt its a dead end, ive thought for a while everything after the duck was a red herring
[08:52] <F2KR> the red herring is all that wind stuff
[08:52] <vtlxx> or the mayan decode being incorrect or misinterpreted
[08:53] <caca> I got onto the 2nd onion page, but now I can't
[08:53] <vtlxx> 2nd onion page was a troll pretty sure
[08:53] <FindUs> what was there?
[08:54] <vtlxx> nothing useful
[08:55] <FindUs> we're at a stage now where everyone can come and say: that's in the mail, look
[08:55] <vtlxx> i doubt there is an email, i've thought for a while we screwed up waaay early on
[08:55] <vtlxx> and/or have been trolled
[08:56] <F2KR> I think the latter
[08:57] <vtlxx> but with the number of people working on it, gonna wait and see while working on shit lol
[08:57] <dull> who have claimed to have gotten the email? and wasn´t  there a (fake?) screenshot of one floating around?
[08:57] <vtlxx> so far only wolf, and i havent seen an ss
[08:57] <FindUs> screenshot was fake
[08:58] <FindUs> there was a pastebin-link but with too many characters, lol
[08:58] <dull> but there was one anyway?
[08:58] <vtlxx> crypto said the whole email thing was to weed out the people who wait and the people who look, but also provided  o proof
[08:58] <dull> mmhm, could be
[08:58] <F2KR> doubt it
[08:58] <fg> that was oo the 2. onion page after they changed it
[08:58] <fg> [06:54] <benjy3301> You have come far, far indeed. We warned you not to share once. We will not warn you again.  This Quest needs a smaller party.  Too late. No more spreading. Good luck.
[08:59] <F2KR> The guys running this have been complaining we have been sharing information. A personalized email would be a nice way to make sure we cannot share
[08:59] <vtlxx> that was real, i saw it
[08:59] <wolf_> :)
[08:59] <cryptopuzzle> I think you don't lok at this right... they said "stop sharing" and people kept sharing... the onion link is on the wiki where any newbie could just copy/paste it in his tor browser and get to the email
[08:59] <vtlxx> but the same time, the 2nd onion was found via suspicious means at besr
[08:59] <cryptopuzzle> if they're actually looking for intelligent persons....
[09:00] <cryptopuzzle> then now they must be rethinking their stuff about how to proceed
[09:00] <F2KR> the second onion was so simple to find
[09:00] <vtlxx> ...then why was it posted on /b/ and reddit? haha
[09:00] <F2KR> Im surprised none of thought to do it sooner
[09:00] <FindUs> vtlxx PM your skype name
[09:01] <vtlxx> if theyre rethinking how to proceed, then there will be emails
[09:01] <caca> Anyone have the /b/ or /x/ threads?
