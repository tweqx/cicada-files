03:22       yumi    i saw it on the b thread yesterday
03:22       Jester  A little lost here, sorry. Seems I missed a step or two. How did we get well.sf.ca.us, and why does that blog keep popping up?
03:22       Run     we must all search /b/
03:23       Run     www.4chan.com/b/
03:23       snogfarth       somebody pointed out earlier that 3301 backwards is 1033.  According to wp, in 1033 everyone thought it would be the end of the world because 1000 years after Jeebus or something.  So, then 3301 starts posting in 2012, when everyone thinks it's the end of the world?  And using Mayan symbols?  Seems awfully coincidental.

03:43       snogfarth       Looking at the full ciphertext, I'm noticing that it looks like normal words and text... punctuation, spacing, capitalization, etc.  Just the letters are changed.
03:44       Run     wait, does anyone still have the paste bin with the _:_
03:44       Jester  So many different letters are singled out.

03:46       Jester  Ok, can SOMEONE fill me in on the logical connection as to how we came about this blog?
03:46       Run     "To find the book, and more information, go to " AND MORE INFORMATION..
03:46       Run     Perhaps we've been looking at the posts as a whole.
03:46       Run     but there's one that can tell us something.
03:46       Run     important.
03:47       Jester  The welcome Mat?
03:47       Run     my thought.
03:47       Run     exactly.
03:47       snogfarth       Yeah, the welcome mat one has the poster's name in green.  unlike the others.
03:47       WaRkAt  the welcome mat leads to the pgp message pastebin...
03:47       snogfarth       But it's also the one that had the PGP stuff
03:47       snogfarth       so maybe that was the "other info"
03:48       Run     then we must make sense of it.
03:48       Run     We've done nothing with that info..
03:48       Run     the mit led us to cicada.
03:49       Jester  http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x181F01E57A35090F
03:49       Run     I know tekk says the keys are basically useless..
03:49       Jester  I don't understand the format of this page. Like, uid sub sig3 sbind etc.
03:50       Run     but that's all that's there.
03:50       snogfarth       Dude. tekknolagi and i have said this a million times: the PGP stuff is just a digital signature.  so we can verify it's 3301 whenever he posts something.
03:50       Run     yes, I understand, but is their something greater to that?
03:50       Jester  Yea. But I'm starting to hit a wall.
03:51       Run     And it doesn't seem the PGP is ANYWHERE on the Reddit..
03:51       snogfarth       The PGP key is on the reddit tho
03:51       Run     where?
03:51       Jester  Running out of ideas. And can anyone tell me WHY that blog has popped up so many times?
03:51       snogfarth       right side.  "Verify:"
03:52       Run     you're right. I honestly don't think the blog is anything.
03:53       snogfarth       I think the reddit posts are the book.  When I looked at that pastebin, it looks... well... just like  a book
03:53       Jester  Its popped up a lot, and I have no clue as to why.
03:53       snogfarth       Maybe some kind of an encrypted book.
03:53       snogfarth       But it said to go to that reddit for the book.  Then he posts all this shit?
03:53       Jester  It said go to redit for the book. There's the book.
03:54       Jester  I think.
03:54       snogfarth       Look at it.  It has capital letters after each period.
03:54       tekknolagi      NOW LETS USE THE CODE
03:54       tekknolagi      LINE&CHAR #s

03:54       tekknolagi      _:_
03:54       WaRkAt  sso we need to apply the pastebin code to the book which is the redit posts?
03:54       tekknolagi      yes.
03:54       Jester  http://pastebin.com/aXYZzzcv
03:54       tekknolagi      i think.

03:57       Run     Are you organizing lines in order of time posted?
