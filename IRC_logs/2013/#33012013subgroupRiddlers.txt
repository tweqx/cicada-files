[2013-01-06 07:45:52] [INFO] Now logging to <file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Administrator/Desktop/UMBRA%20USB/logs/freenode/channels/%2333012013subgroupRiddlers.2013-01-06.log>.
[2013-01-06 07:46:22] <Kenodox> oh nevermind then, my bad
[2013-01-06 07:46:32] <Choncho> Anyway, take Jesus' parables
[2013-01-06 07:46:52] <Choncho> Written as Book:Verse:Line
[2013-01-06 07:46:55] <c4_> Looking at matthews as we speak
[2013-01-06 07:47:06] <Kenodox> I do think that parable has meaning, and i think there is heavy symbolism in this riddle. I don't know what is more important, the symbolism or the word choice
[2013-01-06 07:47:28] <Choncho> The word parable is just a name. A title of sorts
[2013-01-06 07:48:12] <Kenodox> yes, you are correct chonch
[2013-01-06 07:48:20] <Choncho> and i think focusing on that is just a waste of time
[2013-01-06 07:48:30] <Kenodox> I completly agree
[2013-01-06 07:48:31] <c4_> Ok, we'll start elsewhere then
[2013-01-06 07:48:53] <Choncho> Like the instar, tunneling to the surface
[2013-01-06 07:49:14] <Kenodox> I think that half of us should focus on the word choices, their origins, and their meanings, while the other half should focus on the symbolism in the phrases. What say you?
[2013-01-06 07:49:25] <c4_> I think too small groups
[2013-01-06 07:49:32] <c4_> There are only three of us contributing here
[2013-01-06 07:49:37] <Choncho> I think we need to just get a ground understanding of the poem
[2013-01-06 07:49:50] <Choncho> if we all are on the same page, we can move forward easier
[2013-01-06 07:49:57] <Kenodox> yes, choncho is right
[2013-01-06 07:50:11] <Kenodox> what does the poem MEAN really?
[2013-01-06 07:50:24] <Choncho> so this line is a reference to the cicada
[2013-01-06 07:50:51] <Kenodox> I beleive it means that we need to break free of our imagined limitations in order to break the code, but that doesnt make sense, so maybe it is something about the codes limits
[2013-01-06 07:51:02] <Choncho> instar is a pupal stage, cicada lifespan is 13 or 17 years as larva, crawl to the surface and molt to adulthood
[2013-01-06 07:51:23] <Choncho> lets just look at it from a literal view right now
[2013-01-06 07:51:27] <Kenodox> but they used a cocoon metaphor because they are cicada and that is their style
[2013-01-06 07:51:29] <c4_> We need to mature, 13- 17 still adolescant?
[2013-01-06 07:51:39] |<-- Dudewhat has left freenode (Quit: Page closed)
[2013-01-06 07:51:59] <dafvffad> We must shed (3) our own (2) cir-cum-fe-re-nces (5) -10 total               although 9/11 is both prime and public
[2013-01-06 07:52:15] <Kenodox> yes, so maybe they are saying that only adults can join? and it is a message saying that underaged people should back off?
[2013-01-06 07:52:28] <Choncho> yes and no
[2013-01-06 07:52:47] <Choncho> maturity and reaching a higher consciousness
[2013-01-06 07:52:51] <alexanderthegrea> possibly, but i think if the mind is bright enough age doesn't matter to them
[2013-01-06 07:52:52] <c4_> It could be, but most of the people working this aregonna be young, and I don't think that'll stop them.
[2013-01-06 07:53:00] <c4_> I agree there
[2013-01-06 07:53:03] <Choncho> not age dependent
[2013-01-06 07:53:14] <c4_> I think it is combining genuine age with intellectual age
[2013-01-06 07:53:26] <c4_> YOu can be young, but must not think like you are.
[2013-01-06 07:53:38] <Choncho> but anyway its just cicada imagery. a little shout out to the group.
[2013-01-06 07:53:50] <Kenodox> so you have to be able to use things you have learned in your past
[2013-01-06 07:53:54] <alexanderthegrea> it could be but i'd never discount it
[2013-01-06 07:54:14] <Choncho> i think the last two lines are much more important
[2013-01-06 07:54:24] <Choncho> We must shed our own circumferences;
[2013-01-06 07:54:28] <Kenodox> we can't just solve this with intelligence, we have to use our experience, is that what you are getting at c4_?
[2013-01-06 07:54:39] <Choncho> Find the divinity within and emerge.
[2013-01-06 07:54:48] <c4_> I think instar is important, why pick that, there are a thousand anologies of things travelling to the surface
[2013-01-06 07:55:02] <Kenodox> choncho: by circumference do you mean parameters, or the measurement of the parameters?
[2013-01-06 07:55:12] <c4_> Not as such, more shed our experiences
[2013-01-06 07:55:17] |<-- wasond has left freenode (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[2013-01-06 07:55:24] <Choncho> shed our limitations
[2013-01-06 07:55:31] <dafvffad> Because instar plays into the cicada/metamorphosis 
[2013-01-06 07:55:33] <Choncho> not our experiences
[2013-01-06 07:55:41] <Kenodox> yes, thats what i thought!
[2013-01-06 07:55:45] <dafvffad> circumferences is both I believe the distinction is artifictial
[2013-01-06 07:55:53] <Kenodox> but i dont see how that will help us solve a riddle
[2013-01-06 07:56:13] <Kenodox> it might make us better people, but it doesnt really pertain to the riddle
[2013-01-06 07:56:15] <Choncho> BUT ANYWAY. circumference stands out more than any word in the poem
[2013-01-06 07:56:30] <dafvffad> AND it is plural
[2013-01-06 07:56:37] <Choncho> yes
[2013-01-06 07:56:57] <Choncho> either we individually shed multiple or as a a collective, shed our own
[2013-01-06 07:57:07] <Choncho> i vote the second meaning
[2013-01-06 07:57:09] <c4_> or shed as a race.
[2013-01-06 07:57:20] <Kenodox> yes, and they use the words "we" and "our" a lot. Maybe they are saying we need to work as a team and not try to abandon each other the second you find something out?
[2013-01-06 07:57:27] <alexanderthegrea> someone should set the topic to the poem
[2013-01-06 07:57:34] <dafvffad> Multiple circumferences allude to three dimensional space or as you say a shared encapsulation
[2013-01-06 07:57:40] <Kenodox> that is what the topic is, alexanderthegrea
[2013-01-06 07:57:53] <c4_> So, their principles, freedom fighting, helping other people, the poem is telling us to do the same, and to solve it, we must do that.
[2013-01-06 07:58:29] |<-- alexanderthegrea has left freenode (Quit: Page closed)
[2013-01-06 07:58:31] <Choncho> i think its overthinking
[2013-01-06 07:58:33] <Kenodox> but what is "that"? is it issuing a challenge rather than asking us a question? are we supposed to help somebody, and then they will let us join?
[2013-01-06 07:58:43] <c4_> I have a bad grasp of maths, hence why I'm here, but could the numbers then not pertain to a three dimensional shape too
[2013-01-06 07:58:59] <Kenodox> by now I dont even care about JOINING them, i just want to get to the bottom of all this
[2013-01-06 07:59:01] <c4_> Or just help each other
[2013-01-06 07:59:13] <c4_> forgetting the reddit 4chan rivalry shit
[2013-01-06 07:59:20] <c4_> We see people as equals
[2013-01-06 07:59:25] <c4_> as our fellow man
[2013-01-06 07:59:26] <Choncho> lets also not forget the key is all around us
[2013-01-06 07:59:39] <c4_> The internet
[2013-01-06 07:59:48] <c4_> We're doing this, we obviously all spend a lot of time on it
[2013-01-06 07:59:52] <dafvffad> Okay now you're letting the interpretation be an ultimatum. We need to view this as a REFERENCE to the next clue, a signifier rather than an end in an of itself
[2013-01-06 08:00:06] <c4_> You're right
[2013-01-06 08:00:23] <Kenodox> yes, and is that a literal thing, or a symbolic thing? "the key is all around YOU" is what they said, so is it saying that it is all around you, or that is is LITERALLY all around you right now, like your skin
[2013-01-06 08:00:23] <dafvffad> I'm sorry but the specificity of these challenges aren't going to be solved by making a nice post on reddit and giving a homeless guy some change
[2013-01-06 08:01:03] <Kenodox> dafvffad: obviously, but we are trying to see if that would help
[2013-01-06 08:01:07] <c4_> I think the you is internet though. If they say us, it could mean humanity, like I believe their other us of us we etc mean
[2013-01-06 08:01:09] <c4_> but you, is you
[2013-01-06 08:01:17] <c4_> And you, are clearly reading this, on the internet
[2013-01-06 08:01:19] <dafvffad> Well it could be referencing the original file it was in, or for that matter their other puzzles/twitter we're balls-deep in
[2013-01-06 08:01:31] <Choncho> solving this won't have anything to do with helping our fellow man
[2013-01-06 08:01:59] <c4_> It's a large part of what I understand the group stand for.
[2013-01-06 08:02:20] <Choncho> now the last line.
[2013-01-06 08:02:22] <Kenodox> Last year were the clues and puzzles connected? because maybe we need to use this clue to crack the twitter code, and then use the twitter code to crack some other clue
[2013-01-06 08:02:37] <Choncho> that's what im getting at keno
[2013-01-06 08:02:42] <dafvffad> That's how it goes, however we don't know which things are relevent
[2013-01-06 08:03:06] <Choncho> we have a piece of the puzzle which we will have to connect to move on
[2013-01-06 08:03:28] <Choncho> the last line
[2013-01-06 08:03:29] <Choncho> Find the divinity within and emerge.
[2013-01-06 08:03:34] <dafvffad> Hash: Sha1     is one non-poem universality to this. Shai- shy - shy one?
[2013-01-06 08:03:52] <c4_> In which case then. The divinity within. Maybe that's saying we don't need coding and scripts etc for thw twitter part or some other part. We have to do it ourselves, no tech.
[2013-01-06 08:03:53] <Kenodox> if we don't know what is relevent, then we cannot prioritize; we have to decode it all
[2013-01-06 08:04:07] <Choncho> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1
[2013-01-06 08:04:22] <Choncho> not poem related
[2013-01-06 08:04:27] <dafvffad> Which is why I believe this is connected to phi, beyond their penchant for numerology Phi is the "divine" ratio, it has multiple circumferences, and it is an outward, regressive spiral
[2013-01-06 08:04:31] <Kenodox> choncho, where did you get SHA-1 from?
[2013-01-06 08:04:49] <Choncho> now the find the divinity within starts right after the semi colon
[2013-01-06 08:05:01] <Choncho> dafv mentioned it
[2013-01-06 08:05:09] <dafvffad> The divinity within would be the origin of the fibonacci, a single one-dimensional point
[2013-01-06 08:05:19] =-= lolxD is now known as normaldude
[2013-01-06 08:05:39] <Choncho> he was going on a tangent about shy one and stuff. not a bad thought, but its programming stuff
[2013-01-06 08:05:39] <Kenodox> A+B is to A as A is to B. How does that relate to the poem? I agree that THAT is probably what it is referring too, but how do we use it on the twitter code?
[2013-01-06 08:05:41] <c4_> That's a very good point.
[2013-01-06 08:05:50] =-= normaldude is now known as nrmdudeAFK
[2013-01-06 08:06:29] <Choncho> its the start of a brand new clause. a new statement
[2013-01-06 08:06:45] <dafvffad> http://pastebin.com/sSJgTKQD     Hash: Sha1 is in every Cicada related thing I've seen
[2013-01-06 08:06:58] <Kenodox> I think what the poem is saying is that we need to use PHI to break the limitations of the twitter code, and the cocoon metaphors were just cicada being cicada
[2013-01-06 08:07:00] <Choncho> it may mean find the divinity within the poem itself or the song
[2013-01-06 08:07:36] <Kenodox> but what is the divinity? how will we even know once we have found it?
[2013-01-06 08:07:36] <Choncho> yeah its programming stuff dafv
[2013-01-06 08:07:43] <c4_> To be fair, I'm leaning towards what kenodox is saying

[2013-01-06 08:07:58] <Kenodox> thank you c4_
[2013-01-06 08:08:01] <Choncho> i'd say its the way to crack the twitter
[2013-01-06 08:08:29] <c4_> Now I know next to nothing on math, so find the center of phi?
[2013-01-06 08:08:46] <c4_> or rather use phi
[2013-01-06 08:08:54] <c4_> I realise we're riddler,s but any ideas how?
[2013-01-06 08:08:59] <Kenodox> i beleive that the center of phi is 7, but I am not sure
[2013-01-06 08:09:04] <Choncho> its used for the golden ratio
[2013-01-06 08:09:04] <dafvffad> As I said before the semicolon can indicate a command. so: the last line isn't read "We must shed our own circumferences, (to) Find the divinity within and emerge" but rather "We must shed our own circumferences. Find the divinity within and emerge" essentially a double-entendre.

[2013-01-06 08:09:11] <Choncho> sometimes called the divine ratio
[2013-01-06 08:09:25] <c4_> But wasn't this audio
[2013-01-06 08:09:26] -->| scrounger (~scrounger@65.111.169.199) has joined #33012013subgroupRiddlers
[2013-01-06 08:09:33] <c4_> Is the semi colon there or did we add it?
[2013-01-06 08:09:33] <zeke__> In the sphere I am everywhere the center, as she, the circumference, is nowhere found.
[2013-01-06 08:09:34] <Kenodox> dafvffad, that is a great way of putting it
[2013-01-06 08:09:58] <dafvffad> Btw I haven't heard the song anyone hav eit?
[2013-01-06 08:09:58] <Choncho> thats what i was saying about separate clauses dafv
[2013-01-06 08:10:09] <dafvffad> it was with the poem right?
[2013-01-06 08:10:32] <Choncho> the poem was extracted from it
[2013-01-06 08:10:38] <dafvffad> the grammar is original
[2013-01-06 08:10:55] <dafvffad> we didn't add numbers or punctuatijon, or the capitilization, so we should assume it is intentional and relevant.
[2013-01-06 08:11:07] <Choncho> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1fONCH-CY
[2013-01-06 08:11:24] <Choncho> the song
[2013-01-06 08:11:51] <Kenodox> that is because the poem is for everyone. The weird grammar is something they do so that if someone leaks their copy of secret stuff, they know who did it because each document is unique
[2013-01-06 08:12:36] <c4_> Surely then you'd just edit your grammar before leaking it...
[2013-01-06 08:13:03] <Kenodox> ya, thats what one genius did before people knew about the weird grammars purpose
[2013-01-06 08:13:13] <c4_> Oh Ok
[2013-01-06 08:13:32] <Kenodox> nobody knew WHY they were doing it until that guy leaked his stuff
[2013-01-06 08:14:15] <Kenodox> wait, in the song there was a backround pic of a bike resting at a bus stop. has anybody found out where that is?
[2013-01-06 08:14:27] <c4_> IS it important?
[2013-01-06 08:14:36] <Choncho> that was from last year
[2013-01-06 08:14:41] <dafvffad> it's not their video, it's ours
[2013-01-06 08:14:49] <Choncho> it was seoul i think
[2013-01-06 08:15:12] <Choncho> the song was originally an mp3 download
[2013-01-06 08:15:12] -->| immortalghost (76d02610@gateway/web/freenode/ip.118.208.38.16) has joined #33012013subgroupRiddlers
[2013-01-06 08:15:21] <c4_> SO we're thinking that phi is a good shout with divinity, however, surely we must see it's an option that divinity is another clue that parable is an important part?
[2013-01-06 08:15:23] <Kenodox> i have no idea, but when faced with the options of either everything is real or nothing is real, i always go with everything. I think i should use the same philosophy with importance
[2013-01-06 08:15:28] <Choncho> some anon posted so people who didn't download could hear it
[2013-01-06 08:15:32] <dafvffad> Although I must say, The song, if it is original, is of high quality. other than being a vessel for the poem, it's highly recursive.
[2013-01-06 08:15:43] <immortalghost> divinity could also mean to divide
[2013-01-06 08:15:49] <Kenodox> haha ya, its nice to listen to
[2013-01-06 08:16:02] <Kenodox> immoralghost, i dont think so
[2013-01-06 08:16:16] <immortalghost> im not as up to date on this so im probs wrong
[2013-01-06 08:16:24] <immortalghost> so the song is a poem?>
[2013-01-06 08:16:24] <Choncho> FUN FACT: The golden ratio/divine ratio/phi has a hexadecimal representation listed on wikipedia
[2013-01-06 08:16:25] <dafvffad> Neither do I, or it can be an allusion to "Divining"- decyphering
[2013-01-06 08:16:44] <c4_> Which is...
[2013-01-06 08:16:47] <immortalghost> it sounds very familiar
[2013-01-06 08:16:51] <Choncho> i think thats our ticket
[2013-01-06 08:17:01] <Kenodox> dont worry, the wikis arent being updated very often so there is not much you can do but ask us questions
[2013-01-06 08:17:04] <c4_> ah as in divining rods
[2013-01-06 08:17:20] <Choncho> hexadecimal is a way to represent numbers, like binary
[2013-01-06 08:17:24] <immortalghost> well we did get those numbers
[2013-01-06 08:17:26] <Choncho> the tweets are in hexadecimal
[2013-01-06 08:17:30] <Kenodox> oh ho ho by george i think you've got it!
[2013-01-06 08:17:31] <immortalghost> 1,56...
[2013-01-06 08:17:38] <immortalghost> what
[2013-01-06 08:17:44] |<-- smokeymonfrere has left freenode (Quit: Page closed)
[2013-01-06 08:18:38] <Choncho> but it doesn't explain that number
[2013-01-06 08:18:53] <Choncho> also it's irrational, so it repeats nonstop
[2013-01-06 08:18:54] <c4_> I'm still going for isbn
[2013-01-06 08:19:00] <Kenodox> ya, we still need to find the significance of the number
[2013-01-06 08:19:18] <immortalghost> it might not be just one number
[2013-01-06 08:19:21] <immortalghost> but 4
[2013-01-06 08:19:31] <Kenodox> ugh, it seems like we are doing a lot of talking and it feels like we are going somewhere, but we arent making any progress
[2013-01-06 08:19:56] <immortalghost> im giving up for tonight
[2013-01-06 08:19:58] <c4_> It's hard to say if we are, I don't think thi grup is gonna find something conclusive until it's tested.

[2013-01-06 08:21:43] <dafvffad> I tried to search the tweets for phi in hex but got nothing, so it isn't that direct
[2013-01-06 08:21:47] <c4_> What if the seccond one is the important number, the first one being a clue to lead us there?
[2013-01-06 08:21:56] <c4_> Not that I'd know what or how to do with that number
[2013-01-06 08:21:58] <zeke__> Parable 1,595,277,641 adds to 47.  Matthew 13:47-50 is the parable of the net.   no kidding
[2013-01-06 08:22:00] <Kenodox> the second what?

[2013-01-06 08:24:02] <Choncho> well the tweets are ciphered in some way
[2013-01-06 08:24:05] <dafvffad> That's interesting zeke the parabol is about culling the good from bad from the ocean with a net, which is metaphorically what Cicada's doing
[2013-01-06 08:24:14] <zeke__>  exactly
[2013-01-06 08:24:21] <c4_> You then skin a good fish?
[2013-01-06 08:24:22] <Choncho> they all say the same thing. That's why they are the same length
[2013-01-06 08:24:34] <c4_> YOu shed it of the uneeded
[2013-01-06 08:24:49] <bthemightyb> what parable are we working with
[2013-01-06 08:24:54] <bthemightyb> i missed alot
[2013-01-06 08:25:06] <Choncho> where'd you get the 13
[2013-01-06 08:25:08] <c4_> Also Zeke, any reason you chose Matthew for your parables?
[2013-01-06 08:25:14] <zeke__> as well, i posted a little earlier here there is reference to circumference in the book from the first cypher.  chapt 2, line 3
[2013-01-06 08:25:20] <Choncho> thats my question as well
[2013-01-06 08:25:26] <Kenodox> what if "its all around you" means something like evil is all around you? 
[2013-01-06 08:25:31] <zeke__> lol.  just googled parable 47, and it took me there
[2013-01-06 08:26:01] =-= nrmdudeAFK is now known as lolxD
[2013-01-06 08:26:48] <bthemightyb> where are you getting 47 as a starting point
[2013-01-06 08:26:55] <dafvffad> eh that's kinda ambigous and I doubt we'd get a single solid reference for "evil is all around you"
[2013-01-06 08:27:13] <c4_> It's nice, I just think it is a leap, the amount of different ways you could interpret the numbers to get different parabels in the bible alone in staggering, then we'd have to think of the Torah, the Quaran, etc
[2013-01-06 08:27:16] <zeke__> add up the digits from the parable clue and you get 47
[2013-01-06 08:27:18] <c4_> I know this puzzle is long
[2013-01-06 08:27:32] <c4_> But we could probably find a dozen relevant passages
[2013-01-06 08:28:00] <zeke__> quite possible there are other references.  that said, the more we pour over, the more there is to work with
[2013-01-06 08:28:02] <Kenodox> not just this puzzle, but the puzzle that this clue leads too and the one after that and the one after that. we are only two days in and last years puzzle took a whole month
[2013-01-06 08:28:21] <bthemightyb> qabbalah is an interesting topic for translating numerical values and is something i am familiar with
[2013-01-06 08:28:33] <dafvffad> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_10    314'th day, which is related to pi
[2013-01-06 08:28:39] <c4_> I have no idea what you just said...
[2013-01-06 08:29:02] <c4_> is november 10th relevant to us though?
[2013-01-06 08:29:24] <zeke__> kabbalah is an interesting approach as well.  http://www.gematrix.org/ calculates gematria values
[2013-01-06 08:29:30] <n_factor> why the commas
[2013-01-06 08:29:34] <dafvffad> Dunno I'm seaching 11/10/11 regarding the syllables of the poem
[2013-01-06 08:29:37] <n_factor> is the number prime?
[2013-01-06 08:30:15] <zeke__> i counted 11, 9, 11 as syllables.  either way, it ties in to the palindromes that seem to be everywhere in this puzzle
[2013-01-06 08:31:14] <c4_> not either way, 11/10/11 is not a pallindrome.
[2013-01-06 08:31:20] <bthemightyb> i second zeke__ qabbalah is just another spelling. crowley was famous for it as well. i think it really has something to do with it
[2013-01-06 08:31:56] <bthemightyb> there is prolly kabbalistic meaning in a parable from the book of the law
[2013-01-06 08:32:24] <bthemightyb> i just dont know where to begin to look nor do i own the book (anymore)
[2013-01-06 08:32:31] <zeke__> too many references i keep seeing to midline symmetry as well.  something to consider.  the palindromal numbers, references to circles and spheres and i read on the main IRC that the mp3 track mirrors itself halfway through
[2013-01-06 08:35:04] <zeke__> oh yeah, the pauses at 1033 ans 3301 as well
[2013-01-06 08:36:27] <dafvffad> What do we have to work with though, we need to relate some aspects of the poem to something. It has 3 lines, 47 (you said?) characters, 11/9/11 or 11/10/11 syllables, references circumferences and divinity
[2013-01-06 08:36:45] <Choncho> not halfway through exactly
[2013-01-06 08:37:12] <dafvffad> Hebrew of course is both numbers and letters, and it does reference parable/divinity leading to the notion of theology, but again I don't know where to specify..
[2013-01-06 08:37:52] <zeke__> not exactly 47 characters.  i  didn't count that.  but, i did ad up the digits 1,595,277,641 and there i found 47
[2013-01-06 08:37:58] <zeke__> add
[2013-01-06 08:39:16] <bthemightyb> someone referenced working on something to do with the tree of life in a thread. they are an internet organization focused on collecting information on living things. cicada is concerned with info and the freedom of it
[2013-01-06 08:40:03] <bthemightyb> just throwin shit out there
[2013-01-06 08:40:23] <zeke__> concho, it's not 1/2 way?  the outlier might be significant.  
[2013-01-06 08:40:37] <dafvffad> The sephiroth contains circles (circumferences) but I don't see the relevance
[2013-01-06 08:43:50] <Choncho> its at 1:47 or so
[2013-01-06 08:43:59] <Choncho> 1:00 before song ends
[2013-01-06 08:44:14] <Choncho> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1fONCH-CY
[2013-01-06 08:44:23] <Choncho> judge for yourself
[2013-01-06 08:44:52] <zeke__> yeah, i should probably open it up in audacity instread of just listening to it.  the waveform might be more telling.  
[2013-01-06 08:45:23] <zeke__> i just wonder about the choice if it's not dead center.  like a +/- vector  
[2013-01-06 08:46:40] <dafvffad> Again the recursiveness, reference to divinity, within and emergence seem to me to reference Phi - If someone could open up the poem in word with/without the numbers/title and see how many chars it is that may be telling

[2013-01-06 08:54:03] <dafvffad> The use of IN-star emergence is a juxtaposition of inwards/outwards, though beyond that.... We're reaching the stage of interpretation where comprehensive conjecture loses any external references....
[2013-01-06 08:55:02] <c4_> I think you're right
[2013-01-06 08:55:54] <lolxD> is it possible the "parable" is actually par-able ?

[2013-01-06 09:01:15] <guest_____> The parable could have something to do with the book?
[2013-01-06 09:01:29] <Kenodox> maybe
[2013-01-06 09:02:11] <c4_> There is a song called divinity within, an interesting line is, "today you'll bite my neck and peel away the aging skin," it's similar to shedding
[2013-01-06 09:02:20] <c4_> Though i'm sure that's a coincidence, and I'm just fucking tired.

[2013-01-06 09:15:30] <Absence_> In the boot up (seen on wikia) the number first stops at 1033 (174th prime). Also stops on (3301) 464th prime.
[2013-01-06 09:15:53] <Absence_> Would that be a could clue to try and crack the 174th tweet?
[2013-01-06 09:16:27] <Absence_> I also have speculated that it will end on the 464th tweet leaving one last code to be solved.
[2013-01-06 09:16:52] <Absence_> I have one more thought on my mind once this one has been cleared off the board.
[2013-01-06 09:17:03] <dafvffad> the difference between which is 290
[2013-01-06 09:18:10] <dafvffad> that depends on whether 1033 by itself is enough to solve it, and whether or not each tweet is unique in content
[2013-01-06 09:18:25] <Absence_> That brings me to another speculation.
[2013-01-06 09:18:35] <Absence_> Every 5 minutes there is another code, correct?
[2013-01-06 09:18:47] <dafvffad> So far.
[2013-01-06 09:19:10] <Absence_> Each one uses the same method to decode it(whatever that method may be)
[2013-01-06 09:19:35] <dafvffad> So far, it seems to be that way.
[2013-01-06 09:19:36] <Absence_> Why would it send out a new message, it doesn't make sense, right?
[2013-01-06 09:19:51] <dafvffad> So it seems.
[2013-01-06 09:20:23] <Absence_> What if you had to solve one of the other codes, to get the method? Which will then give you a new one every 5 minutes, so you have 5 minutes to decrypt the one set out.
[2013-01-06 09:20:38] <Absence_> Each one would contain a different message, but be 65 bytes.
[2013-01-06 09:20:58] <dafvffad> Either way, the content would have to be decided to be posted in such a manner, and given the amount and scale of each tweet, it's dubious that they are unique in content
[2013-01-06 09:21:21] <dafvffad> I'm not sure what you're getting at
[2013-01-06 09:21:56] <dafvffad> If tweet A is necessary to decode tweet b, then I don't see how tweet c would produce a time limit, and in that case it still comes down to deciphering tweet A
[2013-01-06 09:22:10] <Absence_> Not what I meant.
[2013-01-06 09:22:18] <dafvffad> Elucidate.
[2013-01-06 09:22:24] <Absence_> YOu decode any of the tweets and you figured out the waythey encoded it.
[2013-01-06 09:22:33] <Absence_> (I'm not a coder so I can't verify any of this)
[2013-01-06 09:22:36] <dafvffad> So it would appear.
[2013-01-06 09:22:47] <Absence_> You then wait for the latest or take the latest, and decode that.
[2013-01-06 09:22:47] |<-- bthemightyb has left freenode (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[2013-01-06 09:23:00] <Absence_> But every 5 minutes the encoding is changed so the last one becomes invalid.
[2013-01-06 09:23:21] <Absence_> Where you send the message (which I still have no clue about that) invalids the message and gets a new one every 5 minutes.
[2013-01-06 09:23:38] <dafvffad> I'm still not sure what you mean. If they are all decoded the same manner, then decoding one would essentially decode all of them. And the problem is still in decoding one.
[2013-01-06 09:24:49] <Absence_> Well the method is obviously time consuming, but if you decode one I'm sure it would take at least 5 minutes once the full method is figured out
[2013-01-06 09:24:57] <Absence_> the challenge will be decoding it in 5 minutes
[2013-01-06 09:25:00] <dafvffad> Are you saying decode latest one---> Send it to CIcada and they respond with their plaintext clue?
[2013-01-06 09:25:12] <Absence_> yes
[2013-01-06 09:25:23] <Absence_> but it changes after 5 minutes to prevent followers
[2013-01-06 09:26:09] <zeke__> i am not sure that there is much to decode in the tweets.  consider tweet 000028a: a2800a4a5a2800a28a2800a28a2800a28a2800a28a2800a28a2800a28a2800a28a2800a28a2800a28a2800a28a2800a28a2800a28a2800a28a2800a29296800a28

[2013-01-06 09:26:16] <dafvffad> Although not logically impossible, I don't believe that to be the case. InasmuchasIknow (very little) a codex is still needed to decode a substance.
[2013-01-06 09:26:18] <lolxD> if you want to create 464 different encoding, in 5 minutes each, you cant be going too far from the original one
[2013-01-06 09:26:31] <dafvffad> That would require gaining a codex from the code itself
[2013-01-06 09:27:21] <guest_____> I had an idea, not sure if it would be possible, but it could be a TrueCrypt drive.
[2013-01-06 09:28:23] <coco> so, when do you expect the tweets are going to stop?
[2013-01-06 09:29:13] <dafvffad> We're slowly diverging from riddling and I'm not sure what you mean by that. Truecrypt encodes information utilizing means which aren't unique. The question is still in the substance
[2013-01-06 09:29:45] <guest_____> I dunno, I was just throwing out a possible idea.

[2013-01-06 09:34:30] <Kenodox> "We must shed our own circumferences;" means that we have to look at the perceived limitations of the code, as well as a command that we have to stick together or cicada will drop the whole recruitment, because they are looking for team players, not backstabbers
[2013-01-06 09:36:03] <Kenodox> "Like the instar, tunneling to the surface" is a reference to the organization cicada itself, as well as saying that if we work hard enough and "tunnel" though the problems we will succeed 
[2013-01-06 09:37:02] <Kenodox> and "Parable 1,595,277,641 " is a reference to either the twitter codes or the book of law, and we need to find the passage it refers to. The idea is also being tossed around that it is a bible thing
[2013-01-06 09:37:22] <zeke__> thanks for summarizing all that!

[2013-01-06 10:20:20] <fasd> so this is just me thinking but could the these circumferences be the movements of electrons and the hex numbers from the twitter be colors representing the resonance patterns?
[2013-01-06 10:20:40] <Kenodox> Well, we have already analyzed the poem about breaking out of a cocoon as much as possible, and really right now we just need the coders to crack the twitter code

[2013-01-06 10:26:43] <zeke__> i know.  it's been frustrating to feel so close on these brainstorms and yet without the next clue revealing itself to confirm it.
[2013-01-06 10:27:01] <Kenodox> we extracted it from an mp3 file that was one of the clues they gave us
[2013-01-06 10:27:17] <Kenodox> it is legit
[2013-01-06 10:27:24] <zeke__> the mp3 came as part of the iso file that was early in the game
[2013-01-06 10:27:25] <lolxD> pepenavas : the poem was extracted from .mp3
[2013-01-06 10:27:53] <zeke__> correct.  it's in the headers of the file
[2013-01-06 10:27:55] <pepenavas> okay
[2013-01-06 10:28:00] <Kenodox> really all we can do is wait for the next clue, which the coders will hopefully find when they crack the twitter code.
[2013-01-06 10:28:05] <fasd> so a little off topic from the poem but as of now we have 3 very interesting numbers 3301 761 and 247
[2013-01-06 10:28:19] <Kenodox> most of them went to sleep though
[2013-01-06 10:28:35] <zeke__> has anyone been looking into the huge data files that accompanied the iso?  i started but am getting stumped
[2013-01-06 10:28:52] <fasd> could that be a phone number?
[2013-01-06 10:28:54] <zeke__> they are the bulk of the image

[2013-01-06 10:29:28] <lolxD> I don't think the last year game had any clue about this year
[2013-01-06 10:29:30] <fasd> 247-761-3301
[2013-01-06 10:29:39] <Absencelol> what number is that
[2013-01-06 10:29:57] <fasd> which one?
[2013-01-06 10:30:00] <Absencelol> 247-761-3301
[2013-01-06 10:30:03] <zeke__> true fasd, as the wiki points out 2:47 is 167 seconds, a recip. of the file name
[2013-01-06 10:30:58] <Absencelol> eh
[2013-01-06 10:30:59] <Absencelol> good night

[2013-01-06 17:29:07] <dafvffad> Right so
[2013-01-06 17:29:22] <dafvffad> Since I can do nothing else I'm going to go back to the original poem
[2013-01-06 17:29:32] <dafvffad> and let's try to produce something
[2013-01-06 17:29:45] <dafvffad>  A book whose study is forbidden Once dictated to a beast; To be read once and then destroyed Or you shall have no peace.       9/7/8/6  in terms of syllables/line if I'm not mistaken
[2013-01-06 17:30:20] <anonalaala> that has already been solved
[2013-01-06 17:30:26] <dafvffad> Parable 1,595,277,641  Like the instar, tunneling to the surface We must shed our own circumferences; Find the divinity within and emerge.  Ignoring the title, is either 11/9/11 or 11/10/11 syllables/line
[2013-01-06 17:30:41] <dafvffad> I know, but seeing as how we're at a dead end
[2013-01-06 17:30:48] <anonalaala> gotcha
[2013-01-06 17:30:51] <dafvffad> Perhaps the poems have some connection 
[2013-01-06 17:30:57] <anonalaala> parable
[2013-01-06 17:31:00] <lit_envoy> 11/10/11
[2013-01-06 17:31:02] <anonalaala> is the word that keeps fucking me
[2013-01-06 17:31:14] <anonalaala> wouldn't it be 11/9/11?
[2013-01-06 17:31:21] <yezae> for me its circumferences. why not just circumference
[2013-01-06 17:31:24] <lit_envoy> cir-cum-fer-en-ces
[2013-01-06 17:31:35] <dafvffad> Parable - PAR- able Peak something something or something other technical computer related in the wiki which i'm not familiar with
[2013-01-06 17:32:06] <anonalaala> last year the weird words were clues about computer related things

[2013-01-06 17:32:12] <anonalaala> we're thinking too... abstract
[2013-01-06 17:32:16] <dafvffad> Yeah I thought it was 5 too but the bastardization of it produces 4, which makes the prime 9
[2013-01-06 17:32:20] <anonalaala> they were clues to things like "outguess"
[2013-01-06 17:32:28] <anonalaala> and "caeser cipher"
[2013-01-06 17:32:35] <yezae> anonalaala i had same thought
[2013-01-06 17:32:46] <yezae> cant seem to find any ciphers that relate though
[2013-01-06 17:32:53] <dafvffad> I'm thinking that the prime/even/prime nature of the poem might have something to it
[2013-01-06 17:33:23] <dafvffad> and for that matter, the prime/prime/even/even in descending fashion
[2013-01-06 17:33:28] <dafvffad> Of the first poem
[2013-01-06 17:33:43] <lit_envoy> I think we are barking up the wrong tree.  Maybe it's much simpler...
[2013-01-06 17:33:54] <yezae> im with lit on this one
[2013-01-06 17:34:37] <dafvffad> Oh, of course, but at the moment I can produce nothing more concrete than pure abstraction, and if it leads somewhere we're doing better than nothing
[2013-01-06 17:35:19] <lit_envoy> Indeed
[2013-01-06 17:35:20] <dafvffad> The poems of course don't seem to be related in terms of content
[2013-01-06 17:35:27] <lit_envoy> how about the words themselves
[2013-01-06 17:35:30] <lit_envoy> "parable"
[2013-01-06 17:35:41] <lit_envoy>  Origin: 1275–1325; Middle English parabil  < Late Latin parabola  comparison, parable, word < Greek parabolḗ  comparison, equivalent to para- para-1  + bolḗ  a throwing
[2013-01-06 17:35:53] <lit_envoy> equivalent to something
[2013-01-06 17:35:55] <lit_envoy> to what
[2013-01-06 17:35:58] <lit_envoy> the number
[2013-01-06 17:36:23] <dafvffad> That of course gives good credence to phi, the golden mean, what with parabolas and circumferences and outwardsness
[2013-01-06 17:37:12] <lit_envoy> I believe we should dwell further in not only the possible "meaning of the poem" but the concrete meaning of the words
[2013-01-06 17:37:35] <dafvffad> parable is 3 syllables, perhaps there's some Hebrew equivalence to a number, but I'm not sure if there are parables in the OT
[2013-01-06 17:38:00] <lit_envoy> maybe
[2013-01-06 17:38:09] <dafvffad> Of course if we go by jesus we can still do that biz, since arabic has the same numerology (i believe)
[2013-01-06 17:38:12] <lit_envoy> if divinity does mean the golden mean
[2013-01-06 17:38:15] <yezae> http://www.goldennumber.net/
[2013-01-06 17:38:24] <lit_envoy> he mentions circumference
[2013-01-06 17:38:36] <lit_envoy> and something that equals to the number
[2013-01-06 17:38:58] <lit_envoy> I feel like the answer is among those pieces of information
[2013-01-06 17:39:02] <dafvffad> another bit, was that phi is odd/even/odd/even
[2013-01-06 17:39:11] <dafvffad> And of course pi starts with 3
[2013-01-06 17:39:33] <dafvffad> pi goes odd/odd/even odd, but that doesn't seem to match anything yet
[2013-01-06 17:41:37] <lit_envoy> so
[2013-01-06 17:41:40] <lit_envoy> Golden mean
[2013-01-06 17:41:41] <lit_envoy> we have
[2013-01-06 17:42:00] <lit_envoy> a+b to a as a is to b
[2013-01-06 17:43:31] <yezae> im sure i caught that once at a festival
[2013-01-06 17:44:05] <dafvffad> which would lean towards an entirety applied towards a specificity to yield an equivelance, but I have the feeling that's probably releated to something code-wise
[2013-01-06 17:44:43] <dafvffad> I find 3141 early on in the twitter, but of course with the sheer amount of numbers in that hell-hole
[2013-01-06 17:46:08] <dafvffad> I also find 1618 relatively early on in the twitter
[2013-01-06 17:46:17] <dafvffad> and both of these only once
[2013-01-06 17:46:44] <dafvffad> although loose, it seems to be a relation between pi and phi
[2013-01-06 17:48:08] <dafvffad> and these are of course the same amount of four characters, and they go prime/prime/even/prime  prime/even/prime/even
[2013-01-06 17:50:21] <lit_envoy> wait how did we get this
[2013-01-06 17:50:24] <lit_envoy> "poem"
[2013-01-06 17:50:25] <lit_envoy> anyway
[2013-01-06 17:50:27] <anonalaala> please stop looking at the twitter
[2013-01-06 17:50:30] <lit_envoy> and is it legit?
[2013-01-06 17:50:41] <dafvffad> I just searched for phi/pi in the tweets
[2013-01-06 17:50:41] <anonalaala> it's almost 100% agreed that it is a program being compiled in hex
[2013-01-06 17:50:46] <anonalaala> gotcha
[2013-01-06 17:50:48] <dafvffad> oh the poem
[2013-01-06 17:51:15] <dafvffad> The first poem came from the book file, you can find that on the wiki
[2013-01-06 17:51:33] <dafvffad> The second was found in the same ISO file the song was
[2013-01-06 17:52:26] <lit_envoy> I see
[2013-01-06 17:53:05] <lit_envoy> the song
[2013-01-06 17:53:08] <lit_envoy> as I can hear
[2013-01-06 17:53:10] <lit_envoy> is guitar
[2013-01-06 17:53:17] <lit_envoy> or another stringed similar instrument
[2013-01-06 17:53:21] <lit_envoy> and some effects
[2013-01-06 17:53:43] <anonalaala> the song IS the second
[2013-01-06 17:53:46] <anonalaala> it's the hexdump
[2013-01-06 17:54:13] <dafvffad> Looking at the times of the twitter I get even/prime/even/prime/even  or alternatively even/ prime/prime/even/prime/even/even/rpime/even/evenprime/prime
[2013-01-06 17:54:45] <lit_envoy> brb dinner

[2013-01-06 17:58:50] <dafvffad> When I do this with different time numbers, the pattern rarely changes (such as 11 being present, then 16), and tends to even out towards higher numbers
[2013-01-06 18:00:29] <c4_> I missed the start ofw hat you were saying daf, care to repeat?
[2013-01-06 18:02:03] <dafvffad> Yeah sorry was taking a leak
[2013-01-06 18:02:10] <dafvffad> Nice to see you again
[2013-01-06 18:02:20] <dafvffad> Anyhow I've been going over the twitter
[2013-01-06 18:02:30] <c4_> You too.
[2013-01-06 18:02:33] <c4_> Yep...
[2013-01-06 18:02:36] <dafvffad> I made a giant list on the wiki of it's entirety
[2013-01-06 18:02:59] <dafvffad> and I tried to relate the posting times to other themes
[2013-01-06 18:03:12] <c4_> How so?
[2013-01-06 18:03:25] <dafvffad> For instance we've got the themes of pi and phi
[2013-01-06 18:03:37] <c4_> yep.
[2013-01-06 18:04:06] <dafvffad> pi is 314159 and phi is 1618 - prime/prime/even/prime/prime/prime and prime/even/prime/even, respectively
[2013-01-06 18:04:28] <dafvffad> Now one of the only constants we have in the twitter is the 5 min incrementation
[2013-01-06 18:04:43] <fasd> the twitter is infinitely going much like a circle
[2013-01-06 18:05:03] <dafvffad> since it's 5 minutes this will yield only a certain number of post times at any given start 1/2/3/4- up to 5 min, etc
[2013-01-06 18:05:26] <dafvffad> I seached for both pi and phi
[2013-01-06 18:05:28] |<-- lull has left freenode (Quit: Page closed)
[2013-01-06 18:05:33] <c4_> What do you mean by post times?
[2013-01-06 18:05:46] <dafvffad> In the twitter, and found them early on, both with only up to 4 characters, and posted only once
[2013-01-06 18:06:06] <dafvffad> like if you check twitter "posted 1 minute ago/6 min/11/
[2013-01-06 18:06:20] <c4_> ah ok
[2013-01-06 18:06:28] <dafvffad> Looking at the times of the twitter I get even/prime/even/prime/even  or alternatively even/ prime/prime/even/prime/even/even/rpime/even/evenprime/prime
[2013-01-06 18:06:58] <dafvffad> When I do this with different time numbers, the pattern rarely changes (such as 11 being present, then 16), and tends to even out towards higher numbers
[2013-01-06 18:06:59] <c4_> Nice.
[2013-01-06 18:07:18] <c4_> But surely that is math at work as opposed to them
[2013-01-06 18:07:24] <c4_> I mena I know they set the five mknute intervals
[2013-01-06 18:07:47] <dafvffad> I'm basically just straight analyzing right now but I think phi/pi are connected to the order of the post number
[2013-01-06 18:07:58] <c4_> Good stuff.
[2013-01-06 18:08:07] <c4_> You reckon the posts have/ will in some form start repeating?
[2013-01-06 18:08:08] <dafvffad> Most certainly it's the maths, but for the sake of abstraction I'll consider everything intentional
[2013-01-06 18:08:09] <lit_envoy> I believe that the Divine ratio prognosis was the closes. It starts of with a number (Or an equivalent to it) and mentions circumference and divinity... Does anyone know how The Golden Ratio applies to circles?
[2013-01-06 18:08:11] <c4_> Like a circlr?
[2013-01-06 18:08:20] <dafvffad> the content itself?
[2013-01-06 18:08:39] <dafvffad> It seems unlikely since the @xxxxX is unique
[2013-01-06 18:08:47] <c4_> Fair enough.
[2013-01-06 18:09:01] <dafvffad> I also only found pi and phi once up to 4 chars, never more, and as I said relatively early in that clusterfuck
[2013-01-06 18:09:17] <c4_> I know someon theorised last night that these were codes, only vaqlid for 5 minutes at a time,..
[2013-01-06 18:09:37] <dafvffad> I posted the entirety of the tweets to the wiki as the are so far
[2013-01-06 18:09:46] <c4_> May you link?
[2013-01-06 18:09:52] <fasd> it could be a spiral, like DNA
[2013-01-06 18:10:09] <dafvffad> Yeah, I'm basically just abstracting and trying to find some logic which might possibly apply to this twisted point-and-click adventure game

[2013-01-06 18:10:48] <c4_> Cheers
[2013-01-06 18:11:21] <dafvffad> Also the poems are in the form of prime/prime/even/even for the first and prime/even/prime OR prime/prime/prime for the second
[2013-01-06 18:12:03] <dafvffad> I'm basically just trying to establish some logic for the Coders to play around with, since I've analyzed all the text to death already
[2013-01-06 18:12:53] <lit_envoy> could the number possibly be something in radian units?
[2013-01-06 18:12:54] <dafvffad> But in genreral the post numbers when taken as a whole "11" or "1-1" seem to follow the same pattern
[2013-01-06 18:13:05] <dafvffad> As you said that's the maths of it, but it might be significant
[2013-01-06 18:13:21] <dafvffad> oh wait
[2013-01-06 18:13:23] <lit_envoy> since it does hint at a circle
[2013-01-06 18:13:25] <dafvffad> pi/4
[2013-01-06 18:13:33] <dafvffad> Both are iterated up to 4 chars
[2013-01-06 18:13:35] <dafvffad> Maybe
[2013-01-06 18:13:53] <dafvffad> There ws some notion of polar coordinates last night
[2013-01-06 18:14:33] <sr01>  <c4_> I know someon theorised last night that these were codes, only vaqlid for 5 minutes at a time,..
[2013-01-06 18:14:40] <sr01> what kind of HEX codes are temp
[2013-01-06 18:15:28] <CheeseFingers> it was speculated that they might be urls valid for 5 minutes, but as you can see from the prefix:hex notation it is clearly a file being outputted
[2013-01-06 18:15:36] <c4_> I have no idea, just repeating.
[2013-01-06 18:16:03] <CheeseFingers> the prefix is the location, 65 decimal increments each, the hex is a string of 130 characters
[2013-01-06 18:16:10] <sr01> i still think that we have to wait
[2013-01-06 18:16:25] <CheeseFingers> two hex values, EF for example, take up one location
[2013-01-06 18:16:43] <CheeseFingers> like in 8-bit computing

[2013-01-06 18:19:56] <lit_envoy> if it is... up to what number do you think it's gonna go?
[2013-01-06 18:19:58] <sr01> extraction prog for the data
[2013-01-06 18:20:08] <CheeseFingers> yes i assume that too
[2013-01-06 18:21:21] <sr01> 464 tweets at 5 minute intervals would be 2320 mintutes

[2013-01-06 18:23:33] <dafvffad> the relation between 1033 and 3301 as it were
[2013-01-06 18:23:37] <dafvffad> Nothing conclusiv
[2013-01-06 18:24:13] <c4_> ah ok
[2013-01-06 18:25:33] <lit_envoy> So the best we can do is wait
[2013-01-06 18:25:44] <lit_envoy> and maybe go over the poem afew more times
[2013-01-06 18:25:49] <sr01> yes
[2013-01-06 18:26:02] <sr01> the 464 tweets will be done in three hours
[2013-01-06 18:27:58] <fasd> I hardly think that a group that wants self motivated thinkers to sit on their hands and wait for some magical number of tweets
[2013-01-06 18:28:37] <dafvffad> As someone mentioned earlier it could be a method to "Get everyone on the same page" so that luck of being there first is minimalized, but of course we can't know
[2013-01-06 18:28:49] <sr01> well you could bruteforce their twitter too

[2013-01-06 20:10:03] <anonalaala> that's an interesting point
[2013-01-06 20:10:42] <anonalaala> they have the capacity to send the entire block of hex that they're tweeting

[2013-01-06 20:11:48] <anonalaala> I agree, we shouldn't obsess about it but at the same time, I doubt we're supposed to just idle until it finished... otherwise it would be exactly the same as them just posting it as one huge cluster

[2013-01-07 03:01:49] <Absence_> alright guys, I have another theory
[2013-01-07 03:01:53] <Absence_> so
[2013-01-07 03:01:59] <Absence_> PGP keys consist of 2 parts
[2013-01-07 03:02:03] <Absence_> 1 being public
[2013-01-07 03:02:13] <Absence_> the public key is used to send to us
[2013-01-07 03:02:29] <Absence_> but its obvious we need to send back in some form
[2013-01-07 03:02:42] <Absence_> the primary numbers are probably the key back
[2013-01-07 03:03:06] <c4_> So you want to private the twitter account prime numbers?
[2013-01-07 03:03:27] <Absence_> Well he said the key is all around you
[2013-01-07 03:03:53] <c4_> Good point
[2013-01-07 03:03:55] <Kenodox> it cant hurt to try
[2013-01-07 03:04:01] <c4_> Are primes all around us though
[2013-01-07 03:04:07] <c4_> It just seems a bit abstract
[2013-01-07 03:04:18] <Absence_> took a bit of abstract to get here, right?
[2013-01-07 03:05:10] <Kenodox> i dont think that prime numbers are all around us
[2013-01-07 03:05:16] <Absence_> Using steganography to  end up on a twitter account after booting up a custom OS created by a private group either looking to widely fuck with people or recruit intellectuals is awfully abstract :p
[2013-01-07 03:05:33] <Absence_> Well, here is another 'theory'
[2013-01-07 03:05:35] <c4_> Touche
[2013-01-07 03:05:39] <Absence_> The JPEG image
[2013-01-07 03:05:42] <Absence_> could it be another QR code?
[2013-01-07 03:06:14] <c4_> It could be

[2013-01-07 03:06:58] <Absence_> I was going to suggest wroking backwords, but seeing as a new tweet is coming in every 4 minutes it doesn't seem possible.
[2013-01-07 03:07:27] <c4_> Why not?
[2013-01-07 03:08:14] <Absence_> Well its possible, it is probably just best to wait until they're done popping up.
[2013-01-07 03:08:23] <Absence_> also
[2013-01-07 03:08:25] <Absence_> another issue
[2013-01-07 03:09:03] <Absence_> There has to be a private way to distribute the PGP private key TO cicada, considering they don't want followers, so; does the OS go off after giving you the twitter?

[2013-01-07 03:16:45] <Absence_> The public cicada key is use to distribute information, not to send information to cicada. I'm talking about the pirvate one that will send back to cicada

[2013-01-07 03:18:39] <Lurker69> private key from cicada is only on cicadas computer

[2013-01-07 03:19:09] <Lurker69> if you want to den message to cicad using PGP you have to create your own private key
[2013-01-07 03:19:17] <Lurker69> and send them your public key

[2013-01-07 04:25:21] <Absence_> It realy doesn't make sense.
[2013-01-07 04:26:23] <pr0> i dont see how it has anything to do with chess
[2013-01-07 04:26:36] <Absence_> 0008449: d1c6d86ff796632720b36129cc05712d1c5d31a004df95e81647d4f68846e7904109ce8497d1b6a9824e0329f46afb0a92d4a04e772a640748e22c242b5df50b6c
[2013-01-07 04:26:44] <Absence_> Where that equates to chess blows my mind.
[2013-01-07 04:27:27] <pr0> one long ass chess game with weird ass rules
[2013-01-07 04:28:44] <Absence_> "0008449" if chess, reason for that.
[2013-01-07 04:29:32] <Dafodilianv> hmmm
[2013-01-07 04:30:00] <Dafodilianv> I admit, most of my hypothesis is based on tertiary evidence in the form of loose relations, however
[2013-01-07 04:30:31] <Dafodilianv> I have been working of parsing groups of four characters in the tweets and have come to some success I would say
[2013-01-07 04:30:56] <Dafodilianv> I cannot ignore that 3301, 1033, pi, and phi appear uniquely and individually
[2013-01-07 04:31:19] <Absence_> where does pi / phi appear?
[2013-01-07 04:31:47] <Dafodilianv> And in lieu of finding significant four-char groups, I connected it to chess, because it would also count for the numbers
[2013-01-07 04:31:50] <Dafodilianv> weren't you here
[2013-01-07 04:31:53] <Dafodilianv> here wait a sec
[2013-01-07 04:32:00] <Dafodilianv> Go to the twitter paste
[2013-01-07 04:32:05] <Dafodilianv> and search for pi/phi
[2013-01-07 04:32:17] <Lurker69>  twitter is jpg, we  are pretty much sure about that now
[2013-01-07 04:32:28] <Dafodilianv> which were referenced in the poem probably, and which appear in 4 in the twitter
[2013-01-07 04:33:28] <Dafodilianv> Well until you lot show me a picture ima work on alternatives, because I can't help with that. Besides, there's some meaning behind it
[2013-01-07 04:33:49] <Absence_> They don't appear uniquely nor individually. I would have to say the chess theory is very invalid. You also haven't reasoned for the KEY: part of the numbers.
[2013-01-07 04:34:10] <Dafodilianv> Yes I did, I posted that in the genral
[2013-01-07 04:34:15] <Lurker69> i can explain you how we found out it is a jpg
[2013-01-07 04:34:26] <Dafodilianv> That is a system of tracking game length/move time

[2013-01-07 04:37:59] <Dafodilianv> I do not dispute your theory nor do I reject your evidence, and I do not find them mutually exclusive. I believe that is a good lead and you should follow it. I'll be searching for the next clue as well
[2013-01-07 04:38:10] <Absence_> you say they appear uniquelly in the b64 paste?
[2013-01-07 04:38:19] <Dafodilianv> They did before

[2013-01-07 04:40:03] <Dafodilianv> all appear the same number of times, at regular intervals
[2013-01-07 04:40:19] <Dafodilianv> I said uniquely because previously that was the case
[2013-01-07 04:40:23] <Absence_> and what do those three numbers conclude chess? A set of numbers (im assuming they are all primary) wouldn't approve nor disprove your chest theory.
[2013-01-07 04:40:50] <Absence_> 1618 appeared 3 times.
[2013-01-07 04:40:55] <Dafodilianv> Of course not, as I said it's pure conjecture after reading a wiki article, but it is coherent and although it -
[2013-01-07 04:40:59] <Dafodilianv> As i SAID
[2013-01-07 04:41:05] <Dafodilianv> it appears twice in the original
[2013-01-07 04:41:11] <Dafodilianv> once in the pastebin
[2013-01-07 04:41:13] <Dafodilianv> it would be four
[2013-01-07 04:41:14] <Absence_> So how does 1618 relate to chest?
[2013-01-07 04:41:21] <Dafodilianv> but the pastebin is scrolly
[2013-01-07 04:41:23] <Dafodilianv> it doesn't
[2013-01-07 04:41:26] <Dafodilianv> it's phi
[2013-01-07 04:41:35] <Dafodilianv> the golden ratio, which was the consensu for the poem
[2013-01-07 04:41:38] <Dafodilianv> at least one theme
[2013-01-07 04:41:42] <Dafodilianv> another was a circle- pi
[2013-01-07 04:41:46] <Dafodilianv> which as I said, appears
[2013-01-07 04:41:51] <Dafodilianv> 3301 and 1033 should be obvious
[2013-01-07 04:41:57] <Dafodilianv> As for chess
[2013-01-07 04:42:02] <Dafodilianv> Merely a theory
[2013-01-07 04:42:08] <Absence_> It doesn't work.
[2013-01-07 04:42:11] <Dafodilianv> to explain significant four-char groups, if that is the case
[2013-01-07 04:42:30] <leakhmskill> Absence, just let him work on the chess thing
[2013-01-07 04:42:43] <leakhmskill> if he's wrong, he's wrong and figure it out on his own

[2013-01-07 04:43:00] <leakhmskill> arguing is a waste of time
[2013-01-07 04:43:20] <Dafodilianv> I don't see how you reasoning for the jpg refutes what I say, and I admit it's an absurd tangent and incredibly abstract but everything else I said has been
[2013-01-07 04:46:15] <c4_> I apologise for butting in but this image http://images.4chan.org/b/src/1357529868389.png I saw it weeks ago, before this started, besides that I don't know how old or knew it is, or if it is cicada, however, the last line is "the key is all aroud you"
[2013-01-07 04:46:40] <Lurker69> c4 old shit
[2013-01-07 04:46:50] <Lurker69> i have seen it months ago

[2013-01-07 04:47:14] <c4_> I ddin't think so
[2013-01-07 04:47:20] <c4_> But I mean the last sentence
[2013-01-07 04:47:26] <c4_> It is word for word what cicada said
[2013-01-07 04:47:31] <c4_> IS that a coincidence?
[2013-01-07 04:47:57] <Lurker69> yes i see
[2013-01-07 04:48:12] <c4_> That doesn't seem like just a coincidence to me...
[2013-01-07 04:48:14] <Lurker69> i am not sure if  that last part was in image i saw or not
