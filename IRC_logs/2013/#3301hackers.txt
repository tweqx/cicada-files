[2013-01-06 08:39:30] <primius> welcome to the low-noise coding channel
[2013-01-06 08:39:33] <Lurker69> i hope you are logging this i will be posting relevant links here
[2013-01-06 08:39:48] <primius> https://pastee.org/guv54 <-- to turn twitter format into useful array of bytes
[2013-01-06 08:40:12] <Lurker69> if anyone wants it, this is the xor program I made/the bot uses (with source + command line program): http://ompldr.org/vZ3lvMQ/OtpXor-crashdemons.zip
[2013-01-06 08:40:12] <Lurker69> [06:49]	lulzorz	https://pastee.org/pqrf <-- code to xor tweets with files at various offsets
[2013-01-06 08:41:14] <primius> ^ both posted here and in the pastebin :p
[2013-01-06 08:41:22] <primius> the pad, actually
[2013-01-06 08:41:41] <primius> < Choncho> Coders, look at the hexadecimal for Phi and/or Pi. May be useful
[2013-01-06 08:42:00] <primius> makes sense with circumference references
[2013-01-06 08:43:32] <Lurker69> also i still need to compile outguess and test it, havent done that yesterday

[2013-01-06 08:44:11] <bakpak2hvy> dammit
[2013-01-06 08:44:15] <bakpak2hvy> wait
[2013-01-06 08:44:18] <bakpak2hvy> nevermind
[2013-01-06 08:44:20] <primius> so XORing the first tweet at offset 0 of all three data files and the ISO doesn't give anything file can identify
[2013-01-06 08:44:53] <primius> so I guess a brute force for the correct offset is next?
[2013-01-06 08:45:04] <primius> or perhaps try add/subtract instead?

[2013-01-06 08:53:06] <crash_demons> as I mentioned before in the main channel, may have gotten lost.  "brute forcing" the offset to XOR at isn't hard, if you're expecting a text result.
[2013-01-06 08:53:16] <crash_demons> sliding window scan is pretty fast in C++.
[2013-01-06 08:53:43] <crash_demons> I also posted a program/source before that would do that (which may have gotten buried)
[2013-01-06 08:54:11] <primius> it's on the pad

[2013-01-06 13:09:24] <brotherBox> Good morning. How's it going?
[2013-01-06 13:10:32] <Lurker69> dont know whos idea it was about this sum of  multiples puzzle
[2013-01-06 13:10:55] <brotherBox> primius's idea, judging from the topic.
[2013-01-06 13:10:57] <Lurker69> when i came here primius and scrounge2 were ops
[2013-01-06 13:11:08] <Lurker69> yes sound his style
[2013-01-06 13:12:43] <brotherBox> Any progress since the twitter?
[2013-01-06 13:13:01] <Lurker69> not mauch news but thing are going in right direction
[2013-01-06 13:13:43] <Lurker69> we are  slowwly exhausting all possible leads, most people already know all the  ropes
[2013-01-06 13:16:13] <Lurker69> so people arent discovering that 1231507051321 is palindromic every 2 hours
[2013-01-06 13:16:41] <Lurker69> soon we will al be updated and tuned so we will be able to focus on real problem
[2013-01-06 13:17:12] <Lurker69> wich is in my opinion what to do with twiits and DATA files to get eomething useful aout of it
[2013-01-06 13:17:13] <brotherBox> The wiki sure helps
[2013-01-06 13:17:24] <Lurker69> wiki is main think
[2013-01-06 13:18:10] <Lurker69> it is important that every investigated lead, including all  dead ends are in wiki easily accessable
[2013-01-06 13:18:43] <Lurker69> so that people dont waste time investigating same zhing somebody  investigated 4 hours ago but he didnt bother to posz it in wiki
[2013-01-06 13:19:34] <Lurker69> as i sadi when we will exhaus all the wrong posibilities we will have to focus on real problem

[2013-01-06 23:15:16] <Cheese|busy> That's links to a php script i just wrote to decode the hex to ascii then dump to jpg file
[2013-01-06 23:15:16] <Cheese|busy> you need to use the tweets from http://www.allmytweets.net/?screen_name=1231507051321

[2013-01-06 23:15:17] <Cheese|busy> save as twitter.txt then run script

[2013-01-06 23:18:54] <lulzorz> but it's certainly data
[2013-01-06 23:19:06] <lulzorz> and I recognized the strings before I even saw someone identify as jpg

[2013-01-06 23:19:27] <Cheese|busy> yeah i know, i recognie the ABCD.. etc as well
[2013-01-06 23:19:36] <Cheese|busy> seems similar to other jpg too
[2013-01-06 23:20:01] <Cheese|busy> thing is when i removed some lines from a jpg, it just came corrupted there, but not unreadable

[2013-01-06 23:59:47] <scrounger> mmkay... so I've been thinking...
/* 07 January 2013 */
[2013-01-07 00:00:41] <scrounger> cicada almost always uses prime numbers, right?
[2013-01-07 00:00:47] <scrounger> or weirdly significant numbers
[2013-01-07 00:01:00] <scrounger> but I can't figure out what's special about the length of the ISO file.
[2013-01-07 00:03:57] <Lurker69> it is hard to predict lenght of iso file when you are making it 
[2013-01-07 00:04:12] <scrounger> yeah, but it's cicada.
[2013-01-07 00:04:17] <Lurker69> they should include some padding/filler to make it sertain lenght
[2013-01-07 00:04:31] <scrounger> ok.
[2013-01-07 00:04:32] <scrounger> maybe
[2013-01-07 00:04:37] <Lurker69> that filler would make us think there is something hidden in there if we would detect it
[2013-01-07 00:04:46] <scrounger> how are isos written?
[2013-01-07 00:05:00] <bakpak2hvy> scrounger: carefully
[2013-01-07 00:05:05] <scrounger> like, what's the iso9660 filesystem like
[2013-01-07 00:05:06] <scrounger> ?
[2013-01-07 00:05:12] * scrounger is off to google

[2013-01-07 00:09:57] <scrounger> mmkay.  ISOs are written in sectors of 2KiB (2,048 bytes)
[2013-01-07 00:10:02] <scrounger> http://wiki.osdev.org/ISO_9660
[2013-01-07 00:10:23] <scrounger> So, the ISO couldn't be prime, since it must be divisbile by 2048.

[2013-01-07 00:41:04] <Lurker69> damn it is down

[2013-01-07 01:46:50] <Cuboid3301> The image is only about 3 to 4% complete.... At 478 posts that means that we need at least 11,950 posts to finish the image. Or am I just being stupid?
[2013-01-07 01:47:33] <Lesmo> ... anybody tried mentioning the twitter account? maybe bot can respond some shit?
[2013-01-07 01:47:45] <Absence_> ill send a tweet; but of what?
[2013-01-07 01:48:22] <Lesmo> I was thinking about that... so whatever. Maybe 1033.
[2013-01-07 01:48:57] <Absence_> Sent.
[2013-01-07 01:49:15] <Cuboid3301> We need 11,482 more posts... That will take 32 days o.o
[2013-01-07 01:49:37] <bakpak2hvy> last year the whole 3301 thing only lasted month

[2013-01-07 01:50:37] <primius> technically, last year's is still going on
[2013-01-07 01:50:56] <Absence_> Did my tweet trigger something?

[2013-01-07 01:51:32] <Cuboid3301> Well, someone else try estimating the time. I did it by approximating the completion of the image, which I got 3-4%, then found how many more posts based on that percent would be needed to complete the image.

[2013-01-07 01:52:12] <Cuboid3301> No, the twitter started posting at 4 minute intervals recently

[2013-01-07 01:52:26] <Lesmo> There's the exact times tweets went out
[2013-01-07 01:52:33] <immortalghost> maybe the size of the image is wrong
[2013-01-07 01:52:45] <Absence_> 7:50 -> 7:56 PM - 6 Jan 13 · Details -> 8:00 -> 8:04
[2013-01-07 01:52:45] <absolutezeroff> I guess so yeah
[2013-01-07 01:52:51] <absolutezeroff> Our dimensions are arbitrary aren't they
[2013-01-07 01:52:56] <Absence_> It went from 6 minutes to 4 minutes?
[2013-01-07 01:53:02] <Lesmo> You can clearly see it's now by 4 min
[2013-01-07 01:53:12] <bakpak2hvy> there was only one 6 min. tweet
[2013-01-07 01:53:24] <Cuboid3301> absence_: We noticed. It is causing some confusion in the other IRC too as to why that happened. Right now we don't know
[2013-01-07 01:53:48] <immortalghost> could just be internet
[2013-01-07 01:53:56] <absolutezeroff> Maybe it's similar to the pause in the boot

[2013-01-07 01:55:11] <Absence_> I think MAYBE the 6 minute could either: symbolize that one has some specific meaning or was an accident. I don't think they are ones to make accidents.

[2013-01-07 01:58:06] <Absence_> Oh, they probably did a single 6 minute interval to keep it to a normal schedule. Like how it hit 8:00, it would of hit 8:02 if the 6 minute one didn't appear.

[2013-01-07 03:25:20] <lulzorz> first four are wrong
[2013-01-07 03:25:35] <lulzorz> they should be FFD8

[2013-01-11 04:05:04] <lulzorz> there are some technical issues with that...
[2013-01-11 04:05:24] <lulzorz> wisdom and folly came from the CD, not from xor with .17
[2013-01-11 04:05:33] <lulzorz> actually, I don't think anything's been xored with .17 yet
[2013-01-11 04:05:52] <lulzorz> pretty damn awesome overall though
[2013-01-11 04:31:07] <iIIustrious> for clarity, and because I finally got the free time, I redid all the xoring tonight
[2013-01-11 04:31:50] <iIIustrious> can't open the resulting jpeg, or repair it. So I missed something there
[2013-01-11 04:35:05] <lulzorz> iIIustrious: walk us through what you did
[2013-01-11 04:38:03] <iIIustrious> I just got the twitter data, did an xxd -r to get it in a usuable form, and xored it with 761.mp3
[2013-01-11 04:38:24] <lulzorz> iIIustrious: hexdump of twitter data and what you got from the xor?
[2013-01-11 04:38:58] <iIIustrious> the result had jpeg headers and was recognizably a jpeg, but I get a bogus marker length error
[2013-01-11 04:40:30] <iIIustrious> twitter data
[2013-01-11 04:40:31] <iIIustrious> https://pastee.org/pjjm
[2013-01-11 04:41:04] <iIIustrious> xored https://pastee.org/5wkt2
[2013-01-11 04:41:54] <lulzorz> yeah, you shouldn't see any of the parable in the result
[2013-01-11 04:42:06] <lulzorz> something is fucked with your xoring
[2013-01-11 04:42:11] <iIIustrious> I'd assumed that had something to do with i
[2013-01-11 04:42:12] <iIIustrious> t
[2013-01-11 04:42:32] <iIIustrious> I wondered if it was my xor, so I ditched my program and used the one in the pad up top
[2013-01-11 04:42:37] <iIIustrious> same result
[2013-01-11 04:42:46] <iIIustrious> did other people use an offset I'm not?
[2013-01-11 04:43:17] <soulseekah> no offset, but padding I think

[2013-01-11 04:43:45] <lulzorz> soulseekah: no, that was for xor with the mp3 and .13
[2013-01-11 04:44:27] <lulzorz> iIIustrious: do you mean the crashdemons code or the C source I published?
[2013-01-11 04:44:50] <iIIustrious> https://pastee.org/fu5cw
[2013-01-11 04:44:51] <lulzorz> ./xorfiles twitter.bin 0 mnt/audio/761.mp3 0 should do it
[2013-01-11 04:44:56] <iIIustrious> that guy
[2013-01-11 04:45:14] <lulzorz> yeah, that was mine
[2013-01-11 04:45:26] <lulzorz> I've never had any issues with it 0.o
[2013-01-11 04:45:36] <iIIustrious> how odd
[2013-01-11 04:45:42] <iIIustrious> I'll recompile, try it again
[2013-01-11 04:45:54] <lulzorz> oh, I know what the issue is
[2013-01-11 04:46:00] <iIIustrious> ?
[2013-01-11 04:46:08] <lulzorz> hexdump your twitter file and take a look
[2013-01-11 04:46:09] <lulzorz> you gotta use -c65 on xxd
[2013-01-11 04:46:16] <lulzorz> it doesn't try to detect line length at all
[2013-01-11 04:47:29] <iIIustrious> oh, ok, I'll give that a shot.
[2013-01-11 04:48:35] <iIIustrious> So, I was using an xxd -r to get the twitter data usable, so you mean add the -c65 in there?
[2013-01-11 04:49:28] <soulseekah> probably with -g0 as well
[2013-01-11 04:49:36] <soulseekah> as your pastee doesn't group bytes
[2013-01-11 04:49:59] <lulzorz> iIIustrious: yeah, check the --help/man for xxd
[2013-01-11 04:50:21] <iIIustrious> oh, yeah, it totally doesn't, good call
[2013-01-11 04:50:53] <iIIustrious> yep
[2013-01-11 04:50:55] <iIIustrious> that did it
[2013-01-11 04:50:59] <iIIustrious> thanks gents
[2013-01-11 04:51:06] <lulzorz> see, my code was fine :p
[2013-01-11 04:51:21] <iIIustrious> Haha, I didn't think it was the code
[2013-01-11 04:55:41] <primius> hmmm...no newline at the end of twitter.b64
[2013-01-11 04:55:48] <primius> tsk tsk, bad form

[2013-01-11 14:23:55] <Lurker69> lulzorz: that diaagram isnt finished yes, i didnt descedw how i wil present XOPr finction in it
[2013-01-11 14:24:17] <Lurker69> thinds that were xore has XOR arrow touchind it
[2013-01-11 14:24:31] <Lurker69> the way arrow point doesnt mapper at all
[2013-01-11 14:24:48] <Lurker69> i will use colors to present XOR i think
[2013-01-11 14:25:15] <Lurker69> i want to make sure that it will be obvious wich files we already used and which had never been used
[2013-01-11 14:26:15] <Lurker69> http://prntscr.com/oteup  like this  yellow border one xor "group", different colors other xor "groups"
[2013-01-11 14:26:43] <Lurker69> ond one item can has multiple borders if it was used to xior more than once like tweeter
[2013-01-11 14:37:11] <Lurker69> <primius> this isn't coding...
[2013-01-11 14:37:22] <Lurker69> see ya all laterz
[2013-01-11 15:38:20] <lulzorz> no, I think this counts
[2013-01-11 15:38:42] <lulzorz> you'll want lines going from the things xored to their results
[2013-01-11 15:38:48] <lulzorz> at least, that's how I'd do it

[2013-01-11 16:31:18] <Lurker69> lulzorz: with lines there will be problems...  try to draw lines on diagram and you will see that there will be alot of crossings and problems with placement of datadumps
[2013-01-11 16:31:40] <Lurker69> i want to make it so that is is very clear what has already been used and what not
[2013-01-11 16:31:53] <Lurker69> and to mark all the loose ends
[2013-01-11 16:32:02] <Lurker69> i will figure it out
[2013-01-11 16:32:51] <lulzorz> I think lines are the clearest
[2013-01-11 16:32:55] <lulzorz> color them if you have to
[2013-01-11 16:33:05] <lulzorz> or colored borders, I guess that would work
[2013-01-11 16:33:47] <iIIustrious> that's not bad, to a border of each thing it's been xored with
[2013-01-11 16:33:53] <iIIustrious> or something like that

[2013-01-16 12:09:46] <hops_> is it just me or does the ascii art from the first onion URL look like brainfuck with a non standard syntax?
[2013-01-16 12:29:26] <crash_demons> how many operators does BF have?
[2013-01-16 12:29:44] <crash_demons> IIRC, the ascii art has 8 characters excluding spaces
[2013-01-16 12:31:06] <hops_> BF has 8 instructions and ignores everything else
[2013-01-16 12:32:17] <crash_demons> then by all means, lets run it
[2013-01-16 12:32:49] <crash_demons> careful with the Ctrl+Hing though, since it already has + and ,
[2013-01-16 12:51:29] <hops_> I won't be able to look in to it for the next 6-7hours...
[2013-01-16 12:52:00] <hops_> so if anyone wants to check this out, feel free otherwise I'll do it later
[2013-01-16 12:52:06] <crash_demons> be glad it's not this  http://esolangs.org/wiki/P-prime-prime
[2013-01-16 12:52:30] <VBFH> what exactly is the task?
[2013-01-16 12:53:55] <crash_demons> VBFH, take the cicada ascii art on Onion1 and replace characters with valid Brainfuck operators []<>,.+-
[2013-01-16 12:54:14] <crash_demons> making sure not to create replacement issues since it already contains + and ,
[2013-01-16 12:55:40] <crash_demons> firstly I'd try replacing  I:7?=~  with  []<>.-  in various ways
[2013-01-16 12:55:53] <crash_demons> to avoid replacing , and + assuming its the hint
[2013-01-16 12:56:34] <crash_demons> then you'd have to run the program to see if it returns anything interesting.
[2013-01-16 12:57:55] <VBFH> ok, thank you.
[2013-01-16 13:00:45] <VBFH> could you copypasta the ascii please? can't use tor at my current place
[2013-01-16 13:02:47] <VBFH> so we can ignore spaces and lines because BF-code can be run in one line, right?
