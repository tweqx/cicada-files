[2013-01-05 08:34:29] <scrounger> nadando: line 1 of what book only has 5 words?
[2013-01-05 08:34:46] <Tunaallaking> looklooking at line letter
[2013-01-05 08:34:52] <thenewfag_> We put thirty spokes together and call it a wheel; But it is on the space where there is nothing that the usefulness of the wheel depends. We turn clay to make a vessel; But it is on the space where there is nothing that the usefulness of the vessel depends. We pierce doors and windows to make a house; And it is on these spaces where there is nothing that the usefulness of the house depends. Therefore just as we take advantage 
[2013-01-05 08:34:55] <Gobulcoq> I think you're barking up the wrong tree.

[2013-01-05 08:36:04] <scrounger> last year the book codes were always letter or character. not word, right?

[2013-01-05 08:39:43] <scrounger> immortalghost: try it each way
[2013-01-05 08:39:51] <onon> well liber al vel legis does say it should destroyed after first read
[2013-01-05 08:39:55] <onon> so yeah
[2013-01-05 08:40:01] <Joe_88> im actually making four lines
[2013-01-05 08:40:01] <onon> *be
[2013-01-05 08:40:02] <Choncho> i doubt spaces. punctuation maybe

[2013-01-05 08:40:02] <Cuboid> We need to have half of us on The Book of Law and what ever the other one is
[2013-01-05 08:40:14] <thenewfag_> Hmmm... So after we read it, we can't go back for more clues..
[2013-01-05 08:40:15] <Tunaallaking> It's the book of the law
[2013-01-05 08:40:19] <Joe_88> to account spaces and the exlimations so im writing three.. or four different letter's for each line just to be on the safe side
[2013-01-05 08:40:24] <Choncho> i think its book of law pretty obviously
[2013-01-05 08:40:53] <bakpak2hvy> if book of law doesnt work, there are a lot of other books in the same genre
[2013-01-05 08:40:56] <bakpak2hvy> all listed on wikipedia
[2013-01-05 08:41:06] <immortalghost> im not getting but out of not including spaces, unless its encrypted also so far its etspa

[2013-01-05 08:41:12] <Gobulcoq> I don't think
[2013-01-05 08:41:27] <anon132> it was dictated to him
[2013-01-05 08:41:32] <recharge> Alrights so all agree Book of Law ,now what?

[2013-01-05 08:45:34] <brother> As bakpak2hvy said, the book cipher seems to be for the book of law indeed.
[2013-01-05 08:46:05] <bakpak2hvy> brother: really?
[2013-01-05 08:46:10] <immortalghost> if it helps i think you count every character, spaces and punctuation included

[2013-01-05 08:47:08] <bakpak2hvy> punctuation
[2013-01-05 08:47:15] <bakpak2hvy> no, i think i can do taht
[2013-01-05 08:47:22] <Tunaallaking> not spaces though
[2013-01-05 08:47:22] <bakpak2hvy> any other linux guys in here?

[2013-01-05 08:47:26] <Tunaallaking> yes
[2013-01-05 08:47:31] <anon654154> yes
[2013-01-05 08:47:32] <bakpak2hvy> does wc count spaces?

[2013-01-05 08:47:44] <anon132> both with and without bakpak
[2013-01-05 08:47:49] <brother> bakpak2hvy, yes. You can remove them though.
[2013-01-05 08:47:50] <Gobulcoq> I don't think you're supposed to count spaces
[2013-01-05 08:48:17] <brother> sed / //s or something like that
[2013-01-05 08:48:19] <bakpak2hvy> i was gonna use wc to count these things
[2013-01-05 08:48:25] <brother> sed has a weird syntax iirc
[2013-01-05 08:48:40] <bakpak2hvy> fuck sed, i hate that. but i know im going to have to use it sometime
[2013-01-05 08:49:44] <scrounger> whoa
[2013-01-05 08:49:53] <immortalghost> ok so no DO NOT count spaces or punctuation
[2013-01-05 08:49:57] <scrounger> is anyone actually reading the book of the law?  this is some weird shit.
[2013-01-05 08:50:03] <Tunaallaking> yes
[2013-01-05 08:50:05] <Choncho> no spaces no puctuation. my vote
[2013-01-05 08:50:05] <derpman> yeah, very odd
[2013-01-05 08:50:13] <Tunaallaking> have to count punctuation
[2013-01-05 08:50:17] <Tunaallaking> and - are /
[2013-01-05 08:50:21] <Gobulcoq> No
[2013-01-05 08:50:27] <scrounger> Tunaallaking is saying include punctuation, no spaces
[2013-01-05 08:50:29] <Gobulcoq> Yeah you count punctuation but not spaces
[2013-01-05 08:50:29] <immortalghost> the start WITHOUT spaces or punctuation is http
[2013-01-05 08:50:33] <bakpak2hvy> no punctuation either?
[2013-01-05 08:50:34] <recharge> This has way too many variables, punctuation included, punctuation not included, spaces included, spaces not included ect. Good luck on solving it guys I mean it
[2013-01-05 08:50:45] <brother> How about we just fucking try it out?
[2013-01-05 08:50:49] <Gobulcoq> It's definitely punctuation but not spaces

[2013-01-05 08:51:01] <anon654154> try it both ways but without punc. first
[2013-01-05 08:51:02] <Tunaallaking> so far

[2013-01-05 08:51:12] <Gobulcoq> Punctuation, but not spaces

[2013-01-05 08:51:22] <brother> How about we just shut the fuck up and try stuff out?

[2013-01-05 08:51:36] <bakpak2hvy> ok, i'll count with punctuation first
[2013-01-05 08:52:01] <anon654154> maybe with punctuation is best. look at this in the book
[2013-01-05 08:52:03] <anon654154> My scribe Ankh-af-na-khonsu, the priest of the princes, shall not in one letter change this book
[2013-01-05 08:52:19] <anon654154> so no leaving out punctuation
[2013-01-05 08:52:27] <bakpak2hvy> sounds good
[2013-01-05 08:52:30] <immortalghost> LEAVE IN PUNCTUATION
[2013-01-05 08:52:34] <Choncho> but there are no slashes in the text
[2013-01-05 08:52:36] <anon654154> YES
[2013-01-05 08:52:47] <bakpak2hvy> give me a minutes, gotta format it without the line numbers from the web page
[2013-01-05 08:52:50] <brother> Choncho, I think we have to put them in ourselves.
[2013-01-05 08:53:21] <scrounger> they are using - instead of /

[2013-01-05 09:20:36] <Choncho> this song is awesome. all i got

[2013-01-05 09:25:50] <kashue> at the start of the song
[2013-01-05 09:25:52] <bakpak2hvy> its like 1:34:43
[2013-01-05 09:25:58] <brother> kashue, thats the "bass"
[2013-01-05 09:26:04] <Cuboid> The guitar reversed is very unsettling

[2013-01-05 09:26:37] <Choncho> hey anybody notice how when the primes were loaded up on the screen there was a brief stop on certain numbers?
[2013-01-05 09:26:43] <Lurker69> oihj yes it is
[2013-01-05 09:26:56] <brother> That might have other reasons
[2013-01-05 09:27:02] <anon654154> yeah, but i dont know what numbers
[2013-01-05 09:27:08] <brother> Maybe the numbers aren't displayed but generated on the fly
[2013-01-05 09:27:09] <Tunaallaking> 1033 was one
[2013-01-05 09:27:11] <bakpak2hvy> im tired and might not be thinking straight, but does the first note sound like concert B to anyone else?
[2013-01-05 09:27:14] <immortalghost> someone should defs upload
[2013-01-05 09:27:15] <Lurker69> oihj: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcBDSoVs42M check this
[2013-01-05 09:27:16] <primius> metro 1033 much?
[2013-01-05 09:27:16] <Cuboid> No I didn't notice that. It seemed more random than systematic
[2013-01-05 09:27:17] <xx-pyro> what's the clue you're on
[2013-01-05 09:27:30] <thenewfag_> 1833
[2013-01-05 09:27:31] <Tunaallaking> it was every prime to 3301

[2013-01-05 09:27:37] <brother> xx-pyro, read the topic and download the anonfiles link
[2013-01-05 09:27:37] <nadando> the guitar sounds like it's slightly out of tune
[2013-01-05 09:27:38] <scrounger> wait... it stops on 1033.  then it stops again on 3301.
[2013-01-05 09:27:41] <nadando> makes it more difficult
[2013-01-05 09:27:46] <bakpak2hvy> nadando: im with you
[2013-01-05 09:27:47] <Tunaallaking> !
[2013-01-05 09:27:49] <Choncho> yeah. it was always in the same column too

[2013-01-05 09:27:50] <tjisback> ಠ_ಠ
[2013-01-05 09:27:54] <Tunaallaking> can we listen to the music backwards?
[2013-01-05 09:28:00] <onon> yes
[2013-01-05 09:28:03] <bakpak2hvy> it sounds like a B to me, or what ever major note that is on huitar
[2013-01-05 09:28:09] <bakpak2hvy> *guitar
[2013-01-05 09:28:11] <Guest90282> i got c# as the resolving chord that or E

[2013-01-05 09:28:44] <bakpak2hvy> C# would rule out C
[2013-01-05 09:28:47] <bakpak2hvy> and all flat scales
[2013-01-05 09:28:56] <bakpak2hvy> E could really be anything

[2013-01-05 09:29:10] <bakpak2hvy> or Db
[2013-01-05 09:29:23] <thenewfag_> upload the song on youtube

[2013-01-05 09:44:54] <bakpak2hvy> ^
[2013-01-05 09:45:02] <sammitch> the song is hiding in the cd image
[2013-01-05 09:45:04] <scrounger> good grief. what grade are you people in?
[2013-01-05 09:45:12] <thenewestguy> Dividing by zero is just the thing to avoid...
[2013-01-05 09:45:16] <xx-pyro> did you really just say 0/0=1
[2013-01-05 09:45:17] <bakpak2hvy> 8th reporting in, scrounger
[2013-01-05 09:45:17] <Choncho> Numbers that stuck out for the prime were 503, 541 (rows stopped for them), 1033, and 3301 (stopped generating on them
[2013-01-05 09:45:18] <brother> scrounger, division by 0 isn't defined. Look it up.
[2013-01-05 09:45:18] <Cuboid> YOU CAN"T DIVIDE BY 0!
[2013-01-05 09:45:36] <Sunshine_> You can damn well try.
[2013-01-05 09:45:38] <immortalghost> WHY THE FUCK IS THIS RELEVANT. FUCKING GET BACK TO THE SONG
[2013-01-05 09:45:41] <anon654154> 1231507051321 can be factorized into smaller primes 3 x 7 x 409 x 14338189
[2013-01-05 09:45:43] <nacquiesce> why do we care about the whole prime argument?
[2013-01-05 09:45:43] <sammitch> Anyone working on the MP3 please PM me.
[2013-01-05 09:45:47] <scrounger> brother: true.  Except that... wait for it... anything divided by itself is 1.
[2013-01-05 09:45:54] <immortalghost> THE KEY AS IN FUCKING MUSIC KEYS IS ALL AROUND AS IT SOUND WAVES
[2013-01-05 09:45:55] <thenewestguy> Btw. 12350705321 is the smallest palindromic number. So by saying the key is around you, would that mean a palindromic word involving you?
[2013-01-05 09:45:56] <brother> sammitch, anonfiles link in pastebin
[2013-01-05 09:46:01] <bakpak2hvy> sammitch: which mp3? the iso?
[2013-01-05 09:46:08] <sammitch> yes the mp3 in the iso
[2013-01-05 09:46:16] <sammitch> 761.MP3
[2013-01-05 09:46:18] <scrounger> anyway, here are some usefule things to do: make a youtuve of the booting that we can keep up.  make a youtube of the 3301 song.
[2013-01-05 09:46:22] <nadando> anon654154: wrong #, we're looking at 1231507051321
[2013-01-05 09:46:22] <Cuboid> Zero is the only exception to that rule scrounger!
[2013-01-05 09:46:24] <scrounger> is 761 prime?
[2013-01-05 09:46:37] <brother> scrounger, definition of prime: divisible by itself AND divisible by 1 ONLY. 0 / 1 = 0, but 0/0 => not defined. Ergo 0 != prime.
[2013-01-05 09:46:41] <nacquiesce> the newest guy - yeah, that seems to be the clue.  circumference reference, palindromes, all around us

[2013-01-05 09:57:17] <thenewfag_> https://twitter.com/1231507051321
[2013-01-05 09:57:18] <anonalaala> 41? 82?

[2013-01-05 09:57:43] <xx-pyro> tweeting at exactly 5 min intervals
[2013-01-05 09:57:43] <anonalaala> every 5 minutes on the dot
[2013-01-05 09:57:46] <xx-pyro> if that means something
[2013-01-05 09:57:47] <Cuboid> maybe it is 004182?
[2013-01-05 09:57:55] <brother> I only have two tweets
[2013-01-05 09:57:59] <iIIustrious> I seem to recall that from assembly, could be wrong

[2013-01-05 09:58:51] <Cuboid> 1231507051321 ‏@1231507051321 0000082: 5a5712565b445b5c5b464b12455b465a5b5c12535c5612575f5740559aee54585c314a02561601220056796423586f8cb0616d20456c607366646f626454504531
[2013-01-05 09:58:53] <derpman> if this is a fake, tis well done
[2013-01-05 09:59:05] <bakpak2hvy> 0000082
[2013-01-05 09:59:06] <anonalaala> ok come on
[2013-01-05 09:59:07] <bakpak2hvy> 130 in hex
[2013-01-05 09:59:12] <anonalaala> stop talking about it and start THINKING about it
[2013-01-05 09:59:18] <thenewfag_> That twitter pic is scary dude.
[2013-01-05 09:59:18] <Lurker69> http://www.reddit.com/r/a2e7j6ic78h0j/  this is FROM LAST YEAR!!!  
[2013-01-05 09:59:25] <xx-pyro> i dont know hex :(
[2013-01-05 09:59:27] <xx-pyro> cant help
[2013-01-05 09:59:28] <anon654154> tweets are 5 minutes apart, next in a minute or two
[2013-01-05 09:59:35] <brother> I'll check that twitter pic.
[2013-01-05 09:59:37] <anonalaala> there's 7 digits in the tweet numbers? 0000082?
[2013-01-05 10:00:04] <anonalaala> what kind of code involves 7? that makes no sense.
[2013-01-05 10:00:10] <bakpak2hvy> 0000082 is hex
[2013-01-05 10:00:12] <xx-pyro> yup
[2013-01-05 10:00:13] <xx-pyro> there it is
[2013-01-05 10:00:13] <Cuboid> Is there a possibility that the new codes could translate something new out of last years messages?
[2013-01-05 10:00:14] <bakpak2hvy> its 130
[2013-01-05 10:00:14] <anon654154> twit pic is just same as boot and thread
[2013-01-05 10:00:18] <anon132> nothing in it as far as I can tell
[2013-01-05 10:00:19] <Sunshine_> Not sure how useful this will be for you guys, but here is a translator.

[2013-01-05 10:00:25] <anon654154> NEW TWEET
[2013-01-05 10:00:33] <bakpak2hvy> Cuboid: theres a chance, we should keep out eyes on it but not stress over it
[2013-01-05 10:00:36] <brother> OMG
[2013-01-05 10:00:38] <bakpak2hvy> i dont think they'll do that
[2013-01-05 10:00:42] <kashue> TWITTER CONFIRMED
[2013-01-05 10:00:45] <derpman> okay, new tweet is up
[2013-01-05 10:00:47] <brother> >>> int("41", 16)
[2013-01-05 10:00:47] <brother> 65
[2013-01-05 10:00:47] <brother> >>> int("82", 16)
[2013-01-05 10:00:47] <brother> 130
[2013-01-05 10:01:02] <kashue> hey --- if you save the twitter profile picture..open it in paint
[2013-01-05 10:01:07] <kashue> and paint bucket the edge white
[2013-01-05 10:01:07] <pr0> 1 new tweet
[2013-01-05 10:01:10] <kashue> watch what happens
[2013-01-05 10:01:10] <xx-pyro> or just click on it
[2013-01-05 10:01:12] <xx-pyro> and look closely
[2013-01-05 10:01:13] <anon654154> now there is letters in first charecters. 00000c3:
[2013-01-05 10:01:20] <bakpak2hvy> thats 195 in hex
[2013-01-05 10:01:20] <Cuboid> Knowing how crazy this cicada shit gets maybe they had it planned even this far or even further
[2013-01-05 10:01:22] <brother> If you convert the numbers from hex to int, they make up the length of messages
[2013-01-05 10:01:35] <bakpak2hvy> Cuboid: oh definetely
[2013-01-05 10:01:42] <brother> >>> int("c3", 16)
[2013-01-05 10:01:42] <brother> 195
[2013-01-05 10:01:47] <nadando> brother: no? the first one is 0
[2013-01-05 10:01:55] <xx-pyro> whats the max length of tweets on twitter
[2013-01-05 10:01:56] <brother> Yeah...that was a quick shot.
[2013-01-05 10:01:59] <bakpak2hvy> 160
[2013-01-05 10:02:01] <bakpak2hvy> i believe
[2013-01-05 10:02:06] <derpman> 140 is ma length
[2013-01-05 10:02:10] <brother> ^
[2013-01-05 10:02:18] <xx-pyro> thanks
[2013-01-05 10:02:35] <bakpak2hvy> whoever
[2013-01-05 10:02:49] <anon654154> there are many lurkers in this chat room.

[2013-01-05 10:03:02] <brother> *ba dum tss*
[2013-01-05 10:03:07] <Sunshine_> I'm trying to figure out how to make myself useful.
[2013-01-05 10:03:10] <Lurker69> wat?
[2013-01-05 10:03:17] <Sunshine_> I can't think nor type as fast as a lot of you mother fuckers.
[2013-01-05 10:03:18] <bakpak2hvy> are we saving the tweets?
[2013-01-05 10:03:19] <brother> Screencapped them
[2013-01-05 10:03:21] <anonalaala> wait wat?  There's only 5 zeros... that's hex? I put it in the decoder and get nothing but with 6 zeros I get 195...
[2013-01-05 10:03:21] =-= Mode #33012013 +o brother by Lurker69
[2013-01-05 10:03:22] <brother> bakpak2hvy, I did
[2013-01-05 10:03:25] <Guest90282> they;re scrambling the code
[2013-01-05 10:03:26] <brother> Thanks Lurker
[2013-01-05 10:03:33] <Lurker69> brother behave no unnecessary kicking
[2013-01-05 10:03:34] <Guest90282> it has to be solved withing the 5 min interval
[2013-01-05 10:03:44] <bakpak2hvy> ok, i always forget little things like that
[2013-01-05 10:03:48] <Sunshine_> Well, get cracking.
[2013-01-05 10:03:48] <brother> Lurker69, what I do in the other chan isn't reflective ;)
[2013-01-05 10:04:07] =-= Mode for #33012013 is +cnt
[2013-01-05 10:04:12] <anon654154> yeah the twees come out every 5 minutes on the dot
[2013-01-05 10:04:13] <Choncho> oh shit guest
[2013-01-05 10:04:17] <onon> k couldnt find anything in the twitter pic
[2013-01-05 10:04:19] <derpman> hahaha
[2013-01-05 10:04:26] <derpman> five minutes to solve the puzzle
[2013-01-05 10:04:30] <brother> Its a png
[2013-01-05 10:04:35] <brother> So outguess can't work with it
[2013-01-05 10:04:39] <bakpak2hvy> no steg in pngs, i believe
[2013-01-05 10:04:42] <onon> converted it
[2013-01-05 10:04:45] <kashue> just open it in paint
[2013-01-05 10:04:46] <bakpak2hvy> onon: or that
[2013-01-05 10:04:48] <Gorka_> I don't know if it has anything to do with it , but 1231507051321 is a prime number
[2013-01-05 10:04:50] <bakpak2hvy> lol paint
[2013-01-05 10:04:51] <brother> onon, won't be of use
[2013-01-05 10:04:52] <xx-pyro> it's not in the pic lol
[2013-01-05 10:04:53] <onon> k
[2013-01-05 10:04:56] <kashue> and paint bucket it
[2013-01-05 10:04:58] <Cuboid> Has anyone done oneguess on the twitter photo?
[2013-01-05 10:05:00] <brother> Converting destroys information
[2013-01-05 10:05:04] <bakpak2hvy> Cuboid: cant, its a png
[2013-01-05 10:05:07] <brother> Cuboid, no use since its a png
[2013-01-05 10:05:13] <Sunshine_> Damn...
[2013-01-05 10:05:13] <Lurker69> Gorka_: even more http://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php/1231507051321.html
[2013-01-05 10:05:16] <Sunshine_> One step ahead.
[2013-01-05 10:05:22] <Cuboid> So there is nothing you can do to that photo?
[2013-01-05 10:05:24] <anon654154> NEW TWEET 0000104:
[2013-01-05 10:05:25] <derpman> NEW message
[2013-01-05 10:05:37] <anon654154> 0000104: 57d6fa283c736695101608363b3f320e08171b1c120e0876757d7e700f0b1412101115143237333f3c362929161c1f1be7eaecedf9f8fae4e3efe0e61d2526202e
[2013-01-05 10:05:38] <brother> Cuboid, the cicada logo is hidden in it
[2013-01-05 10:05:47] <brother> If you paint the background white and set a low threshold
[2013-01-05 10:05:48] <Cuboid> I saw that
[2013-01-05 10:05:51] <bakpak2hvy> are all twitter profile pics 256x256?
[2013-01-05 10:05:57] <brother> But other than that...I'll check that.
[2013-01-05 10:06:04] <Sunshine_> Did anyone try using GIMP on the image yet?
[2013-01-05 10:06:06] <derpman> guys, ignore the twitter pic, concentrate on the frekaing code in the tweets
[2013-01-05 10:06:12] <iIIustrious> it's not hidden in it, you can see it normally if you look close
[2013-01-05 10:06:13] <xx-pyro> ^
[2013-01-05 10:06:20] <xx-pyro> to both the above
[2013-01-05 10:06:21] <xx-pyro> ^
[2013-01-05 10:06:27] <brother> iIIustrious, indeed.
[2013-01-05 10:06:34] <Cuboid> I think the twitter is a false lead... Why would cicada post ANYTHING that didn't add more information?
[2013-01-05 10:06:36] <brother> But painting helps to illustrate it ;)
[2013-01-05 10:06:45] <Sunshine_> I'm aware of the damn code, but the picture has to mean something
[2013-01-05 10:06:46] <brother> Well, every kind of feedback IS information
[2013-01-05 10:06:52] <derpman> cuboid, its posting info, we just cant access it yet
[2013-01-05 10:06:52] <anon132> another new one
[2013-01-05 10:07:14] <buslove> what do you mean? they give us a bootable CD that displays a twitter address, then that twitter address starts posting code? sounds EXACTLY like what cicada would do
[2013-01-05 10:07:15] <anonalaala> it's not hex
[2013-01-05 10:07:21] <Choncho> THE PICTURE MEANS NOTHING IT IS A CALLING CARD
[2013-01-05 10:07:22] <iIIustrious> I'm not sure how code is a false lead, but 3301 is known for players messing with eachother with false leads
[2013-01-05 10:07:31] <thenewfag_> it looks like it was multiplying... 0000000-0000041-0000082..
[2013-01-05 10:07:37] <Cuboid> I am speaking about the twitter photo being a .png    They have never done that before have they?
[2013-01-05 10:07:45] <anonalaala> 7 digits every time
[2013-01-05 10:07:46] <brother> >>> int("82",16)
[2013-01-05 10:07:47] <brother> 130
[2013-01-05 10:07:47] <brother> >>> int("c3",16)
[2013-01-05 10:07:47] <brother> 195
[2013-01-05 10:07:47] <brother> >>> int("104",16)
[2013-01-05 10:07:47] <brother> 260
[2013-01-05 10:07:49] <brother> This is odd.
[2013-01-05 10:07:55] <Sunshine_> That is indeed odd...
[2013-01-05 10:08:01] <Sunshine_> But every bit helps.
[2013-01-05 10:08:15] <anonalaala> what is "int"
[2013-01-05 10:08:28] <xx-pyro> interval
[2013-01-05 10:08:29] <Choncho> i need to go to bed but i dont wanna
[2013-01-05 10:08:30] <brother> Its a function to convert to an int
[2013-01-05 10:08:32] <onon> srsly
[2013-01-05 10:08:35] <bakpak2hvy> it looks the iso plays in here somewhere
[2013-01-05 10:08:40] <brother> From base 16 in this case.
[2013-01-05 10:09:02] <Cuboid> 41 is 7 x 2 x 3 and 82 is 7 x 2 x 2 x 3 I doubt that means anything though
[2013-01-05 10:09:17] <xx-pyro> 82 is 41x2
[2013-01-05 10:09:19] <immortalghost> new code
[2013-01-05 10:09:20] <xx-pyro> means nothin
[2013-01-05 10:09:22] <xx-pyro> thats chance
[2013-01-05 10:09:24] <Sunshine_> Is this or is this not hex?
[2013-01-05 10:09:25] <brother> xx-pyro, that just hex though
[2013-01-05 10:09:28] <anonalaala> so the next should be 325 right? so what would that be?
[2013-01-05 10:09:30] <immortalghost> 0000104: 57d6fa283c736695101608363b3f320e08171b1c120e0876757d7e700f0b1412101115143237333f3c362929161c1f1be7eaecedf9f8fae4e3efe0e61d2526202e
[2013-01-05 10:09:31] <onon> any news on the audio?
[2013-01-05 10:09:32] <Sunshine_> It does not seem to mean anything.
[2013-01-05 10:09:33] <Guest90282> always five 0's and then an increase in numeral with the exception of the c3
[2013-01-05 10:09:35] <xx-pyro> yeah thats what im saying
[2013-01-05 10:09:41] <xx-pyro> itwas random luck
[2013-01-05 10:09:44] <nadando> incrementing by 1.5
[2013-01-05 10:09:49] <thenewfag_> c3...
[2013-01-05 10:09:52] <Tunaallaking> 195
[2013-01-05 10:10:03] <Cuboid> and 104
[2013-01-05 10:10:17] <anonalaala> brother, what would int("x", 16) be to get 325
[2013-01-05 10:10:19] <brother> 145 will be next I think.
[2013-01-05 10:10:34] <brother> anonalaala,
[2013-01-05 10:10:49] <immortalghost> could the start be colours?

[2013-01-05 10:11:19] <kashue> yes
[2013-01-05 10:11:20] <brother> Cuboid, yes

[2013-01-05 10:11:22] <xx-pyro> brother has
[2013-01-05 10:11:23] <immortalghost> nevermind not colours
[2013-01-05 10:11:28] <bakpak2hvy> so what do we do with it now?
[2013-01-05 10:11:37] <xx-pyro> howd you figure 15
[2013-01-05 10:11:37] <brother> >>> 260 + (195-130)
[2013-01-05 10:11:38] <brother> 325
[2013-01-05 10:11:38] <brother> >>> hex(325)

[2013-01-05 10:11:39] <anon654154> how many tweets will there be and what are they for?  what about the song?!?!
[2013-01-05 10:11:41] <xx-pyro> ?
[2013-01-05 10:11:48] <brother> anon654154, no idea yet.
[2013-01-05 10:11:49] <bakpak2hvy> oh shit
[2013-01-05 10:11:51] <Cuboid> Sweet! Is there a way to see if the alphanumeric values also follow the same pattern?
[2013-01-05 10:11:52] <brother> We have to organise the information
[2013-01-05 10:11:55] <Tunaallaking> this has been awesome and fun, but I'm sick and bedtime is now. If someone awesome wants me they can find me.
[2013-01-05 10:11:58] <bakpak2hvy> the song, that might be important
[2013-01-05 10:12:08] <nadando> next should be 145
[2013-01-05 10:12:11] <nadando> rihgt?
[2013-01-05 10:12:12] <thenewfag_> c^3??
[2013-01-05 10:12:12] <thenewestguy> Have we deciphered the tweets at all? I went to go do serious thinking. And I didn't come up with anything.

[2013-01-05 10:12:17] <Choncho> I've been listening on repeat i got nothing
[2013-01-05 10:12:24] <nadando> and it is
[2013-01-05 10:12:25] <thenewestguy> If we haven't got anything, why don't we just wait out the tweets.
[2013-01-05 10:12:33] <Sunshine_> Can I get a link to the song?
[2013-01-05 10:12:33] <bakpak2hvy> im listening to it, but im not finding much
[2013-01-05 10:12:40] <anonalaala> where can I find the ISO and also, we agree the tweets are not hex correct?
[2013-01-05 10:12:49] <brother> Guys, we have a shitload of information like the song, the prime number sequence, the palindrome, the text
[2013-01-05 10:12:50] <Cuboid> Is there a way to see if the alphanumeric values also follow the same pattern?
[2013-01-05 10:12:53] <brother> How about we just order it for now?
[2013-01-05 10:12:55] <Sunshine_> I thought they might have been.
[2013-01-05 10:12:57] <nadando> after 145 it's 186
[2013-01-05 10:13:02] <anon132> the text?
[2013-01-05 10:13:12] <thenewfag_> Wait...
[2013-01-05 10:13:29] <Guest90282> all i know is the key is G# and the chord prorgression is a basic 2-5-1 in a minor scale
[2013-01-05 10:13:30] <Sunshine_> What if we chop the numbers into groups of 2 or 3? that might translate into ASCII
[2013-01-05 10:13:31] <brother> 186 will be next

[2013-01-05 10:14:21] <Sunshine_> Well, I don't think I will be very much help beyond listening to it.
[2013-01-05 10:14:22] <kashue> guys..
[2013-01-05 10:14:27] <kashue> the c3 must mean something
[2013-01-05 10:14:28] <Sunshine_> More tweets?
[2013-01-05 10:14:30] <kashue> its odd and out of place
[2013-01-05 10:14:32] <bakpak2hvy> sounds like G# to me
[2013-01-05 10:14:48] <anonalaala> I don't think the c3 is relevant... it's just hexi for the next interval
[2013-01-05 10:14:52] <kashue> c3 sounds like a guitar strumming placement

[2013-01-05 10:16:45] <anon654154> we need to see if the tweets match the song! strumming pattern, chords something
[2013-01-05 10:16:48] <immortalghost> first digit goes 0, 1, 2
[2013-01-05 10:16:58] <immortalghost> second goes  0, 4, 8, 0

[2013-01-05 10:17:09] <immortalghost> last goes 1, 2, 3, 4
[2013-01-05 10:17:10] <nadando> it's just a multiplication by successive fractions, 2/1, 3/2, 4/3, etc
[2013-01-05 10:17:23] <Timmytimtim> I figured it out.
[2013-01-05 10:17:31] <Guest90282> from what i see none of it correlates to a pattern on guitar
[2013-01-05 10:17:32] <immortalghost> go on then timmy
[2013-01-05 10:17:38] <bakpak2hvy> im out for a few minutes
[2013-01-05 10:17:39] <Timmytimtim> It is, 42.

[2013-01-05 10:18:07] <brother> What?
[2013-01-05 10:18:12] <Guest90282> the only idea i have is take the number after the five 0's and find its character within the text
[2013-01-05 10:18:12] <nadando> 1010101010101010100000000000001020 that's suspicious as hell

[2013-01-05 10:18:28] <Timmytimtim> Im sorry about my jimmy rustlin thought it would be a funny thing to say you know it being the answer to everything and all.

[2013-01-05 10:18:42] <Choncho> THIS IS SERIOUS SHIT TIM
[2013-01-05 10:18:43] <Timmytimtim> So how deep are we on this?
[2013-01-05 10:18:49] <Sunshine_> Not very.
[2013-01-05 10:18:52] <anonalaala> I thought that looked odd too but... it's more than likely a coincidence
[2013-01-05 10:18:52] <anon654154> VERY DEEP
[2013-01-05 10:18:58] <brother> The 00000000 part is very strange.
[2013-01-05 10:18:59] <Choncho> INCEPTION DEEP
[2013-01-05 10:19:07] <anon132> we're stuck at an impasse. we have a song a twitter and an iso
[2013-01-05 10:19:14] <brother> If it was a xor encryption (with whatever), then this pattern would be VERY improbable.
[2013-01-05 10:19:16] <anon654154> BEAT ME TO IT CHONCHO
[2013-01-05 10:19:17] <anonalaala> very very very NOT deep if my history with these hunts is any indication
[2013-01-05 10:19:18] <xx-pyro> the next is 207?

[2013-01-05 10:23:53] <thenewestguy> A key for what? If we need music shit, I have 3 musically talented friends near me. Or is the music thing screwed?
[2013-01-05 10:23:57] <brother> We KNOW about the two lines. I said its jus tID3
[2013-01-05 10:24:07] <primius> Sunshine_: any decent media player can display that
[2013-01-05 10:24:08] <brother> pr0, that isn't true either.
[2013-01-05 10:24:10] <brother> >>> int("c3", 16)
[2013-01-05 10:24:10] <brother> 195
[2013-01-05 10:24:24] <derpman> the whole parable thing?
[2013-01-05 10:24:34] <Sunshine_> I'm a lazy bastard. I'm depending on you to do all the work.
[2013-01-05 10:24:45] <anon654154> that Spectrograph  isnt anything interesting
[2013-01-05 10:24:49] <Lurker69> thx onon, i suspected that it isnt anthing there but it was worth a try
[2013-01-05 10:24:54] <xx-pyro> brother does that function
[2013-01-05 10:24:55] <Timmytimtim> Perhaps converting the letters to numbers would do something
[2013-01-05 10:24:55] <xx-pyro> ever hit 761
[2013-01-05 10:25:00] <Lurker69> joy comes with the pursuit
[2013-01-05 10:25:06] <onon> wtf
[2013-01-05 10:25:12] <Timmytimtim> A-Z = 36
[2013-01-05 10:25:14] <brother> Okay guys, I propose the following: we organize all the information we have and stop with "analysing" the tweets for a second.
[2013-01-05 10:25:19] <anon654154> lurker is weird
[2013-01-05 10:25:22] <Timmytimtim> A being 1 and z being 36
[2013-01-05 10:25:33] <anon654154> i second brother
[2013-01-05 10:25:34] <brother> The tweets aren't a clean source of information.
[2013-01-05 10:25:38] <derpman> i agree with brother
[2013-01-05 10:25:42] <nacquiesce> good call @brother, this was getting innane
[2013-01-05 10:25:42] <anon132> you obviously mean 26 for z right?
[2013-01-05 10:25:44] <immortalghost> if we can predict the numbers... what does 0003301 say?
[2013-01-05 10:26:04] <Sunshine_> Good question...

[2013-01-05 10:29:28] <anon132> could it be an encryption key? maybe to something in the file?

[2013-01-05 10:31:47] <anon654154> BROTHER IS RIGHT

[2013-01-05 10:31:58] <greatjustife> we will figure this out
[2013-01-05 10:32:01] <brother> Consider this: the tweets might only be relevant after we figured out the stuff in the image.
[2013-01-05 10:32:11] <Choncho> we knew that newest guy
[2013-01-05 10:32:13] <onon> can we pls make a pastee with all the hints so far and what we should focus on
[2013-01-05 10:32:19] <nacquiesce> what good is another tweet if we can't decrypt it yet?
[2013-01-05 10:32:22] <anonalaala> wait hey, guest just copy pasted the EXACT text
[2013-01-05 10:32:33] <anon654154> the music is where were stuck, so lets focus on that.
[2013-01-05 10:32:43] <pr0> what music?
[2013-01-05 10:32:44] <n_factor> what do we have so far? must be encrypted. the key is all around you. also primes.
[2013-01-05 10:32:49] <Sunshine_> What about it?
[2013-01-05 10:32:49] <greatjustife> what is the song?
[2013-01-05 10:32:50] <iIIustrious> whoever guest is, if that's the case, we'll need more before we can use it
[2013-01-05 10:32:56] <brother> The correlation of the tweets and the appearance of the image are too improbable to be coincidence.
[2013-01-05 10:33:04] <iIIustrious> I think just wait for the twitter to do it's bot thing, and see what's left
[2013-01-05 10:33:06] <brother> I reckon the image is the key to the tweets.

[2013-01-05 10:38:14] <nadando> last 2 tweets have some significant similarities
[2013-01-05 10:38:16] <Guest90282> circumference is referencing ones shell or outer skin
[2013-01-05 10:38:24] <Guest90282> it just sounds poetic to me
[2013-01-05 10:38:27] <ConfederateYanke> This is amazing.
[2013-01-05 10:38:31] [ERROR] The user ``brother'' is not known to ChatZilla.
[2013-01-05 10:38:37] <iIIustrious> it's an odd word to use for outer shell
[2013-01-05 10:38:40] <greatjustife> people maybe
[2013-01-05 10:38:49] <xx-pyro> not when refered to instar

[2013-01-05 10:38:57] <iIIustrious> it emplies a more circular shape then you'd expect
[2013-01-05 10:38:58] <Sunshine_> Hey, I just noticed something. The second picture of the black screen with all the white numbers on it in the original thread, the name of the song linked at https://anonfiles.com/file/b4a0a572aa4e307facb9e75e37a364b5 is at the bottom of the screen. Did anyone else notice that yet?
[2013-01-05 10:38:58] <Guest90282> all around us
[2013-01-05 10:39:03] <Cuboid> Do you see how many times 2800a is repeated in this new one? It has also broken the pattern
[2013-01-05 10:39:16] <Guest90282> circumference refers to the part all around you
[2013-01-05 10:39:24] <Choncho> the songs name is instar emergence
[2013-01-05 10:39:32] <greatjustife> did you guys find the key?
[2013-01-05 10:39:37] <Guest90282> i agree that word hits now

[2013-01-05 10:43:33] <Sunshine_> Please.
[2013-01-05 10:43:39] <greatjustife> 716 is an area code for Parable Farms
[2013-01-05 10:43:43] <Timmytimtim> Hmm
[2013-01-05 10:43:46] <Timmytimtim> Never mind
[2013-01-05 10:43:53] <Cuboid> timmy say it anyways
[2013-01-05 10:44:03] <thenewestguy> Just a weird coincidence, but The Instar Emergence has a cicada's call in it.
[2013-01-05 10:44:06] <Lurker69> Sunshine_: i dont see tilte of any song on that  http://images.4chan.org/b/src/1357373692810.jpg
[2013-01-05 10:44:09] <brotherBox> greatjustife, thats interesting
[2013-01-05 10:44:13] <primius> hmmm, linux people will be interested to note that /lib/modules/3.0.21-tinycore/kernel/drivers/net/phy/cicada.ko.gz exists on the filesystem
[2013-01-05 10:44:23] <greatjustife> ye ah
[2013-01-05 10:44:29] <greatjustife>  ill keep digging
[2013-01-05 10:44:32] <Sunshine_> If you download the song from the link it downloads as 761. There is a 761 at the bottom of the screen.
[2013-01-05 10:44:33] <brotherBox> Not for me primius
[2013-01-05 10:44:41] <primius> they wrote their own freaking custom kernel module
[2013-01-05 10:44:49] <Timmytimtim> 0000000:,0000041: ,0000082:, Then its broken by 00000c3:   Perhaps that stops the chain perhaps because this is twitter mind you you only have a certin amount of room to type.
[2013-01-05 10:44:54] <brotherBox> Or do you mean in the image primius?
[2013-01-05 10:45:04] <Cuboid> Sunshine the image on /b/ was not the end of the string
[2013-01-05 10:45:07] <greatjustife> its in the big apple
[2013-01-05 10:45:10] <Timmytimtim> Either the end of that chain or the begining of the next perhaps the codes go together
[2013-01-05 10:45:11] <Lurker69> Sunshine_: i got it 761 is title
[2013-01-05 10:45:14] <thenewestguy> Parable Farms... Whatï¿½s In Your Beef? weird mistake?
[2013-01-05 10:45:14] <thenewfag_> you have 140 characters per tweet
[2013-01-05 10:45:17] <Sunshine_> I told you.
[2013-01-05 10:45:24] <Cuboid> the string kept going until 3301
[2013-01-05 10:45:33] <bthemightyb> the google image search on the pic was a farm road. route 666 i think. maybe this is religious? cicada is a locust right. or a form of locust. end of the worl genesis. 2012. think about it
[2013-01-05 10:45:36] <greatjustife> call them?
[2013-01-05 10:45:52] <Sunshine_> Someone could give them a call.
[2013-01-05 10:45:54] <brotherBox> Timmytimtim, that is not true
[2013-01-05 10:45:55] <Timmytimtim> And if sunshine is correct we need about 23-25 tweets in total
[2013-01-05 10:45:59] <primius> brotherBox: it's in 3301.img
[2013-01-05 10:46:01] <Sunshine_> But I am going to look more into 761/
[2013-01-05 10:46:02] <primius> alias mdio:????????????1111110001000001???? cicada

[2013-01-05 10:46:06] <primius> also found that ^
[2013-01-05 10:46:11] <brotherBox> Wtf
[2013-01-05 10:46:26] <scrounger> bro... they made their own liveCD... why wouldn't they make their own kernel modules
[2013-01-05 10:46:30] <greatjustife> well parable farm is in NY
[2013-01-05 10:46:32] <primius> not sure if it's significant or not
[2013-01-05 10:46:38] <Sunshine_> The song has to be named 761 for a reason.
[2013-01-05 10:46:40] <brotherBox> primius, I'll look into it.
[2013-01-05 10:46:46] <Lurker69> bthemightyb: cicada is not religious, it is mostly about freedom of information and right for anonymity on internet, at least that was what they were saying last year

[2013-01-05 11:36:47] <Thefinalkill> I saw that quote about Sheding the cercumfrence

[2013-01-05 11:37:11] <Thefinalkill> The equation for cercumfrance is pi r squared
[2013-01-05 11:37:15] <onon> if you put the song in a hex editor it gives https://pastee.org/yqaf3 <- we're stuck at that atm besides other clues
[2013-01-05 11:37:49] <derpman> circumference, key is all around us, wasnt the key of the song C?
[2013-01-05 11:37:59] <Dingolordofbabie> C for carbon?
[2013-01-05 11:38:03] <onon> i thought g#
[2013-01-05 11:38:15] <Thefinalkill> There is also the fact that those creatures are called sand lions when they are babies. Lions have manes in the shape of cicles. Maybe it has something to do with that
[2013-01-05 11:38:16] <derpman> dide we ever come down on one key? c or g?

[2013-01-05 11:49:31] <Lurker69> looks like hype from the beginnig slowed down, chat isnt scrolling madly fast anymore, i like  more that way
[2013-01-05 11:49:37] <Alcy> 1,595,277,641 -> 1,10,8.11 ->http://www.utrace.de/ip-adresse/1.10.8.11
[2013-01-05 11:49:50] <Cuboid> The dates of creation and last modification shows that it has nothing to do with Cicada
[2013-01-05 11:49:55] <anon069> alcy whats that addres
[2013-01-05 11:49:56] <anon069> s
[2013-01-05 11:50:04] <Sunshine_> The phone number seems to be the only similarity...
[2013-01-05 11:50:19] <Sunshine_> I think it might have something to do with the phone number.
[2013-01-05 11:50:21] <Alcy> just playing around with the numbers of 1,595,277,641
[2013-01-05 11:50:24] <anon069> whos gonna call? post recording or at least transcribtion
[2013-01-05 11:50:25] <Alcy> adding digs and shit
[2013-01-05 11:50:35] <Sunshine_> I called already, no one answered.
[2013-01-05 11:50:38] <onon> how did you get from 595 to 10 ?
[2013-01-05 11:50:43] <Sunshine_> I think an anon called earlier but nothing important happened.
[2013-01-05 11:50:45] <anon069> fuck
[2013-01-05 11:50:53] <Cuboid> yeah but Cicada wouldn't have created the site 10 years ago
[2013-01-05 11:50:56] <derpman> i called parable farms
[2013-01-05 11:51:00] <onon> ah quersumme
[2013-01-05 11:51:01] <derpman> voicemail message was plain
[2013-01-05 11:51:05] <yezaee> second @Cuboid
[2013-01-05 11:51:06] <anon069> plain?
[2013-01-05 11:51:08] <Sunshine_> I told you
[2013-01-05 11:51:08] <Cuboid> That is way to far back
[2013-01-05 11:51:09] <derpman> no numbers, no odd phrasing
[2013-01-05 11:51:10] <Sunshine_> No info
[2013-01-05 11:51:10] <Alcy> 5+9+5 = 1+9 =10
[2013-01-05 11:51:22] <onon> yeah sry awake for 27 hrs
[2013-01-05 11:51:28] <Lurker69> from time to time bumb https://boards.4chan.org/b/res/448685556#p448711120, i we lost it we have to post new one and explain to all the noobs all stuf from old posts
[2013-01-05 11:51:42] <anon069> cant banned
[2013-01-05 11:51:49] <Cuboid> The only relation to Cicada Parable Farms has is with its number and even then it is an insignificant connection
[2013-01-05 11:51:52] [ERROR] The command ``x/'' is not known to the server.
[2013-01-05 11:51:59] <Lurker69>  /x/ is slower you can leave thread for few hours and it usually survives
[2013-01-05 11:52:00] <anon069> nothing is insignificant here
[2013-01-05 11:52:04] <Sunshine_> 761 seems to be a pretty reliable connection
[2013-01-05 11:52:08] <derpman> yeah, i really think the farm is a dead end
[2013-01-05 11:52:17] <Sunshine_> Are the other numbers in the phone number on the list of prime numbers?
[2013-01-05 11:52:19] <anon069> unless its a plastic duck, we need to consider
[2013-01-05 11:52:20] <Thefinalkill> You know that could be a phone number. That would not make sence though
[2013-01-05 11:52:34] <Thefinalkill> 159-927-7641
[2013-01-05 11:52:36] <Sunshine_> We already tried to make a phone number earlier.
[2013-01-05 11:52:39] <Sunshine_> Didn't work out
[2013-01-05 11:52:43] <Cuboid> insignificant does not mean it has no place in the investigation. It just means it should be our least priority at this point
[2013-01-05 11:52:50] <Lurker69> anon069: nothing is insignificant but there can be some deliberate red herrings, so not necessary for every lead to lead somwhere
[2013-01-05 11:52:51] <Sunshine_> I think it was 232 761 3301 we called.
[2013-01-05 11:52:52] <anon069> just checking: have we moved on from the twitter?
[2013-01-05 11:53:01] <onon> its a side chain
[2013-01-05 11:53:12] <yezaee> you know the poem. thats got to be important as is the song....
[2013-01-05 11:53:20] <immortalghost> wasnt there an image in the dropbox file?
[2013-01-05 11:53:21] <anon069> true lurker, but we still should check everything
[2013-01-05 11:53:22] <Sunshine_> What is the poem called?
[2013-01-05 11:53:22] <onon> 1. https://pastee.org/yqaf3 2. twitter 3. linux image
[2013-01-05 11:53:23] <anon069> even if dead end
[2013-01-05 11:53:26] <thenewestguy> The twitter is just being monitored, we haven't figured it out.
[2013-01-05 11:53:31] <anon069> we need to consider is all i said
[2013-01-05 11:53:51] <Lurker69> anon069: indeed, actuall joy comes with the pursuit
[2013-01-05 11:53:52] <Cuboid> I haven't. I think I am starting to uncover numerical values to some letters
[2013-01-05 11:54:05] <onda> 4. the mp3
[2013-01-05 11:54:06] <anon069> who has linux? im on my laptop i dont have my tri boot

[2013-01-05 11:55:15] <Sunshine_> What do these numbers at the beginning mean? >.<
[2013-01-05 11:55:20] <anon069> it was in the file location
[2013-01-05 11:55:21] <immortalghost> well cicadas live usually 13 or 17 years

[2013-01-05 11:55:32] <anon069> just looking around

[2013-01-05 11:55:57] <anon069> otp22? story in itself?
[2013-01-05 11:55:58] <thenewestguy> I'm gonna go kill myself. Sorry guys, can't help.

[2013-01-05 11:56:22] <Sunshine_> I say work on the poem next. After we get that shit straightened out we can work a bit on that fucking phone number.
[2013-01-05 11:56:23] <Lurker69> arg made by some pfreakers
[2013-01-05 11:56:28] <Lurker69> all about telephones
[2013-01-05 11:56:44] <Lurker69> it is going on for longer than a year now
[2013-01-05 11:56:47] <onda> Yeah, the poem seems like the most solid clue
[2013-01-05 11:57:01] <Lurker69> http://otp22.referata.com/wiki/Main_Page otp22 wiki
[2013-01-05 11:57:02] <Sunshine_> Hey, I just had an idea...
[2013-01-05 11:57:02] <Sunshine_> Hear me out

[2013-01-05 11:57:39] <anon069> thanks lurker
[2013-01-05 11:57:41] <Sunshine_> Parable farms has gift certificates... What if the number by the word Parable in the Pastee is the activation code?
[2013-01-05 11:57:53] <Lurker69> if anybody interested in phreaking and audio ciphers #arg is chanel for OTP22
[2013-01-05 11:58:07] <Lurker69> but i am sure it has nothing to do with cicada
[2013-01-05 11:58:16] <Sunshine_> I'm just saying, it's worth a shot.
[2013-01-05 11:58:19] <anon132> parable farms is a dead end
[2013-01-05 11:58:21] <Lurker69> we still have no clue who is PM of OTP though
[2013-01-05 11:58:24] <onda> maybe... try it
[2013-01-05 11:58:45] <onon> maybe we should audiosurf the mp3
[2013-01-05 11:58:49] <anon069> dont rule out farms

[2013-01-05 12:02:31] <yezaee> we should concentrate on the litreture. note the word circumfrenceS, meaning more than one.
[2013-01-05 12:02:48] <Sunshine_> Yeah, good point
[2013-01-05 12:02:49] <anon069> circumfrence. that word.
[2013-01-05 12:02:56] <Sunshine_> Does it have to do with pi?
[2013-01-05 12:03:00] <Sunshine_> 3.14?
[2013-01-05 12:03:11] <yezaee> yeh. to find the circumference
[2013-01-05 12:03:18] <Lurker69> http://www.alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM    rtelatively fast and easy to use factorization link
[2013-01-05 12:03:22] <yezaee> then take that away from the original number?
[2013-01-05 12:03:31] <Sunshine_> I dont know
[2013-01-05 12:03:40] <anon069> christian recourse makes it look like jesus had 17 parawhateves. cicada. 17. jesus.

[2013-01-05 12:04:00] <anon069> THE BIBLE.
[2013-01-05 12:04:07] <Sunshine_> I'm aware of that
[2013-01-05 12:04:13] <anon069> sorry.
[2013-01-05 12:04:17] <Sunshine_> We have thought of the bible.

[2013-01-05 12:04:25] <anon069> i should.

[2013-01-05 12:04:42] <Sunshine_> I'm not going to because I'm probably going to fall asleep.
[2013-01-05 12:04:46] <Cuboid> mercurial_: No there is no significance. That image was only half of the whole string of prime numbers
[2013-01-05 12:04:47] <yezaee> like the instar http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instar
[2013-01-05 12:04:50] <onon> yeah me too

[2013-01-05 12:06:08] <Alcy> 1595277641 is a indian phone number
[2013-01-05 12:06:09] <Lurker69> 1595 277641 = 1031 x 1229 x 1259 
[2013-01-05 12:06:10] <onon> let em lurk, lots of ppl are here for quite some time now half of em are probably sleeping on their keyboards

[2013-01-05 12:06:22] <onon> check the wiki
[2013-01-05 12:06:23] <anon069> k
[2013-01-05 12:06:25] <yezaee> to me the poem says: a parable, to look at something differently and learn from it. the instar. In order for us to grow we need to she our mortal coils and change what we are. Find what we are at our core and move forward
[2013-01-05 12:06:30] <Sunshine_> https://anonfiles.com/file/b4a0a572aa4e307facb9e75e37a364b5 here you g

[2013-01-05 12:06:38] <anon069> i have the dl, but thanks.
[2013-01-05 12:06:43] <Sunshine_> alrighty then
[2013-01-05 12:06:45] <Cuboid> We have pretty much lost all of our primary decipherers
[2013-01-05 12:06:46] <Lurker69> onon: get used to it, people are logged in to keep logs
[2013-01-05 12:06:51] <Sunshine_> I can't get over the name
[2013-01-05 12:06:55] <Sunshine_> 761
[2013-01-05 12:07:04] <onon> lurker im just saying to  anon

[2013-01-05 12:07:34] <anon069> 761. hmmm.
[2013-01-05 12:07:49] <Cuboid> I think I am unlocking some more clues to the Twitter page
[2013-01-05 12:07:52] <Sunshine_> I still think parable is a good place to look.
[2013-01-05 12:07:57] <Lurker69> we can make part in kwiki with tutorials about PGP and how to check if signature is legit, about factorizations and about outugess
[2013-01-05 12:07:58] <onon> both are
[2013-01-05 12:08:04] <immortalghost> well first image posted was called 232. 232-761-????
[2013-01-05 12:08:06] <derpman> parables arent jsut a biblical thing
[2013-01-05 12:08:08] <Sunshine_> 761 is the name of the song, as well as the middle 3 digits of their phone number.

[2013-01-05 12:35:48] <yezaee> I've got a feeling the twitter could be from a future step
[2013-01-05 12:36:02] <immortalghost> and started tweeting only today
[2013-01-05 12:36:14] <anon069> could be, last time they solved a future step before the current step
[2013-01-05 12:36:27] <anon069> well, the puzzle was given today
[2013-01-05 12:36:29] <yezaee> seems like they will point us to that twitter to an exact time
[2013-01-05 12:36:42] <anon069> i disagree
[2013-01-05 12:36:44] <Lurker69> last years reddit had  identification of PGP key in comments Verify: 7A35090F
[2013-01-05 12:36:46] <anon069> its constant

[2013-01-05 12:36:58] <anon069> alrighty, thanks
[2013-01-05 12:37:09] <Cuboid3301> That could have been started by a troll though. It didn't start posting until hours after the first Cicada post hit the imageboards
[2013-01-05 12:37:20] <Draget> it started tweeting almost at the time the @1231507051321 number was discovered
[2013-01-05 12:37:33] <anon069> they had a timed post keeping people waiting days. the twitter is most likely legit

[2013-01-05 12:40:05] <Cuboid3301> Would affine ciphers do anything with the twitter posts?
[2013-01-05 12:40:37] <mercurial_> how did we get the parable thing?
[2013-01-05 12:40:41] <immortalghost> well theres the iso, the song, the twitter, and the parable
[2013-01-05 12:40:43] <Cuboid3301> No idea
[2013-01-05 12:40:47] <immortalghost> we got the parable from the file
[2013-01-05 12:40:50] <anon069> anyone think the reason theyre using twitter is because they need, say, a set amount of folowers or something?
[2013-01-05 12:40:50] <immortalghost> at dropbox
[2013-01-05 12:40:59] <anon069> say 17?
[2013-01-05 12:41:04] <immortalghost> nah
[2013-01-05 12:41:07] <mercurial_> but did we get it before or after the twitter

[2013-01-05 13:20:55] <Cuboid3301> onon, the twitter one comes out much different than that one
[2013-01-05 13:21:08] <Cuboid3301> the cicada one I mean
[2013-01-05 13:21:20] <onon> depending on the settings used

[2013-01-05 13:30:27] <Cuboid3301> they outguessed an image and it gave book codes and a riddle
[2013-01-05 13:30:47] <anon654154_> the book was anassumption from last years book
[2013-01-05 13:30:53] <Cuboid3301> we answered the riddle which led us to the book
[2013-01-05 13:30:54] <onon> the first number specified the chapter, the others words in the text
[2013-01-05 13:31:06] <Cuboid3301> then we used the book codes which gave us a website

[2013-01-05 13:31:18] <anon654154_> it lead us to a dropbox link
[2013-01-05 13:32:25] <Cuboid3301> We hit the wall -_-
[2013-01-05 13:32:33] <onon> i guess the two big leads are the parable text and and the twitter

[2013-01-05 13:33:06] <onon> oh yeah the linux iso too
[2013-01-05 13:33:08] <Cuboid3301> But I got excited by my false lead ;-;
[2013-01-05 13:33:19] <onon> ^^ nice motivation though
[2013-01-05 13:33:23] <onon> you have there
[2013-01-05 13:33:30] <scrounger> I bet there's tons of shit in the 130MB of the ISO
[2013-01-05 13:33:37] <anon654154_> and the timed tweets. they started just after we figured out the iso so someone is watching
[2013-01-05 13:33:54] <DingoLordOf3013> Is anyone listening to me when I say that the twitters name leads to that page. Which is a page based on solving numeral based riddles
[2013-01-05 13:34:04] <scrounger> eh, maybe... or they had it timed anyway, for 2-3 hours after posting. could be either way

[2013-01-05 14:06:44] <Cuboid3301> I have reason to believe that there is something hidden in the last 30 seconds of the np3
[2013-01-05 14:06:48] <Cuboid3301> mp3*
[2013-01-05 14:07:12] <Cuboid3301> But I have no idea how to isolate it

[2013-01-05 14:07:50] <immortalghost> coolio
[2013-01-05 14:07:56] <Alcy> use Audacity
[2013-01-05 14:08:11] <Alcy> to play around with the mp3
[2013-01-05 14:08:51] <immortalghost> i swear someone found an image in the file
[2013-01-05 14:08:59] <Cuboid3301> I don't know how haha. All I can tell is that the last 30 seconds has very odd looking frequencies
[2013-01-05 14:09:49] <Alcy> wait
[2013-01-05 14:09:53] <onon> did you check the spectrograph? nothing that would come over like a msg http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytVxSBM2OEQ

[2013-01-05 14:16:09] <Draget> Someone noticed the song is named "The Instar Emergence", artist "3301"?
[2013-01-05 14:16:40] <Cuboid3301> Everyone already knew that

[2013-01-05 14:17:12] <Draget> i just saw that u.u
[2013-01-05 14:17:32] <onon> that just means that there is a hole in the higher frequencies at that point
[2013-01-05 14:17:46] <Cuboid3301> Ok
[2013-01-05 14:17:48] <onon> it goes from left to right low->high

[2013-01-05 14:27:54] <thaltbw> there must be some kind of encryption for direction

[2013-01-05 14:28:48] <immortalghost> i was going to say the hex goes from a-f and so does music but it doenst

[2013-01-05 15:06:37] <nigg> I solved it a year ago.

[2013-01-05 15:07:37] <Cooper_> Have they come into play yet?
[2013-01-05 15:08:02] <wet> I think it's sinusoidal encryption

[2013-01-05 15:09:18] <anon654154> there were some cool patterns and the image somehow resembled 1231...

[2013-01-05 15:31:50] <anon654154> yez, i said the same thing, but people have their doubts
[2013-01-05 15:31:51] <NOTYEZAEE> anon, on the ISO. was ther anything else?
[2013-01-05 15:32:08] <NOTYEZAEE> like after the camera stopped in your vid?
[2013-01-05 15:32:11] <Cooper_> Exactly what I said earlier Yez. About not using the same stuff as before, that is.

[2013-01-05 15:33:02] <Cooper_> Hang on. I got the iso as well. I'm going to boot into a VM and see what I might be able to find.
[2013-01-05 15:33:18] <NOTYEZAEE> this full thing is about tech knowledge. I'd focus on the ISO and the cryptography
[2013-01-05 15:33:25] <NOTYEZAEE> everything else is just filler
[2013-01-05 15:33:35] <anon654154> i have a question: what on the iso makes it so large? all the files i have found have only been a couple mb
[2013-01-05 15:33:43] <NOTYEZAEE> its the data file
[2013-01-05 15:33:48] <NOTYEZAEE> its 130MB

[2013-01-05 15:34:07] <Cooper_> The twitter updates every five minutes on the nose. Have we made any ground on that front?
[2013-01-05 15:34:27] <anon654154> oh, but why? making prime numbers pop up doesnt take 114+ mbs
[2013-01-05 15:34:39] <NOTYEZAEE> nah, i get the feeling the next step is gonna point to a particular entry which will be unique for each person who gets to that stage
[2013-01-05 15:34:54] <NOTYEZAEE> that way they won't have to worry about hangers on, they will be able to filter the traffic
[2013-01-05 15:35:04] <Cuboid3301> Hey lurker69, what should we do about all the lurkers. I want to test everyone's theory of us being watched. Anyone who is idled will be kicked. If they get back on quickly, we are being watched.
[2013-01-05 15:35:22] <Cooper_> Grr. I wish I wasn't a hanger and could actually find something...

[2013-01-05 16:01:01] <cooper2> Might be easiest to run it through a spectrogram to identify the notes. Easier to see things visually that way.

[2013-01-05 17:06:24] <anon654154> ill link to scrounger video
[2013-01-05 17:06:27] <Gobulcoq> Anyone wanna update? Or has nothing else happened?
[2013-01-05 17:07:05] <absolutezeroff> So I think I arrived when we were trying Huffman encoding
[2013-01-05 17:07:13] <absolutezeroff> Did we get anywhere with that?
[2013-01-05 17:07:17] <Cooper_> First I have to make a damn ubuntu VM
[2013-01-05 17:07:24] <Gobulcoq> Or not.
[2013-01-05 17:08:15] <Cooper_> Looking at it now, i'm not sure it is huffman.
[2013-01-05 17:08:19] <scrounger> So, when I was making the video I noticed something
[2013-01-05 17:08:19] |<-- ano8968 has left freenode (Quit: Page closed)
[2013-01-05 17:08:22] <scrounger> about the song.
[2013-01-05 17:08:33] <Cooper_> Looking at huffman encoded text, they don't seem to match.
[2013-01-05 17:08:40] <Cooper_> What did you notice?
[2013-01-05 17:08:54] <scrounger> The song is exactly 2 minutes and 47 seconds long, right?
[2013-01-05 17:09:02] <anon654154> yeah
[2013-01-05 17:09:09] <scrounger> Ok, convert that to seconds
[2013-01-05 17:09:17] <scrounger> 167 seconds.
[2013-01-05 17:09:24] <scrounger> Which, guess what 167 is...
[2013-01-05 17:09:26] <anon654154> i never thought of that
[2013-01-05 17:09:41] <scrounger> 167 is prime
[2013-01-05 17:09:52] <absolutezeroff> 761
[2013-01-05 17:09:58] <scrounger> It's also the reverse of 761, which is also prime, and the name of the mp3 file
[2013-01-05 17:10:15] <anon654154> mind=blown
[2013-01-05 17:10:36] <Gabriel_> Holy shiet
[2013-01-05 17:10:48] <Cooper_> That's all fine and dandy, but where does that get us?
[2013-01-05 17:10:57] <scrounger> fuck if i know
[2013-01-05 17:11:00] <Yezae> man he sure loves them primes
[2013-01-05 17:11:12] <Cooper_> HOLY SHIT
[2013-01-05 17:11:16] <scrounger> but, what i saw last year was that they are super particular about everything.
[2013-01-05 17:11:18] <Cooper_> Primes
[2013-01-05 17:11:25] <scrounger> i mean, crazy shit that we wouldn't notice
[2013-01-05 17:11:28] <scrounger> until way later
[2013-01-05 17:11:30] <Cooper_> Don't you get it? The Cicadas are transformers!
[2013-01-05 17:11:35] <brotherBox> No you
[2013-01-05 17:11:37] <lull> lol
[2013-01-05 17:11:38] <scrounger> and then realize it was a clue that would have gotten us ahead faster
[2013-01-05 17:11:40] <Cooper_> Led by optimus prime!
[2013-01-05 17:11:54] <absolutezeroff> So uh
[2013-01-05 17:11:55] <scrounger> like the gpg key, the comment is some number
[2013-01-05 17:11:59] <absolutezeroff> What's the cracked book code?
[2013-01-05 17:12:19] <scrounger> turned out that was a few steps later into the test last year. we could've skipped like 3 steps ahead had we noticed it.
[2013-01-05 17:12:22] * Cooper_ shoots self in the head.
[2013-01-05 17:12:40] <Lurker69>  b thread died
[2013-01-05 17:12:58] <anon654154> yeah it was a quiet death
[2013-01-05 17:13:00] <scrounger> so, what the fuck is up with this song anyway?
[2013-01-05 17:13:10] <anon654154> WE DONT KNOW
[2013-01-05 17:13:13] <Lurker69> not much for now
[2013-01-05 17:13:23] <Lurker69> apparently you can play it backwards 
[2013-01-05 17:13:25] <lull> so wheres the song anyway?
[2013-01-05 17:13:30] <brotherBox> Read the topic
[2013-01-05 17:13:33] <scrounger> i mean, i'm no musician, but doesn't it sound weird to anyone else?
[2013-01-05 17:13:37] <Lurker69> lull standby
[2013-01-05 17:13:39] <brotherBox> God damnit why do we need to discuss everything 9000 times?
[2013-01-05 17:13:40] <Cooper_> We know that the song is in the key of G#
[2013-01-05 17:13:40] <thaltbw> I played it backwards and heard nothing out of the ordinary
[2013-01-05 17:13:49] <absolutezeroff> Perhaps we can analyze chords.
[2013-01-05 17:14:18] <sephiap> maybe run it through spectral analysis, didn't radiohead have an entire song dedicated to creating images in the waveforms?
[2013-01-05 17:14:23] <scrounger> because by going over it that 9001st time, we might just find the thing that will get us ahead
[2013-01-05 17:14:28] <anon654154> theres notes mixed with the chords so that would be difficult
[2013-01-05 17:14:41] <scrounger> hold on
[2013-01-05 17:14:46] <absolutezeroff> I know quite a bit about music theory but am not professionally trained in the slightest
[2013-01-05 17:14:51] <scrounger> you guys are taking it way more complicated than i meant for now
[2013-01-05 17:15:03] <Lurker69> lull https://www.dropbox.com/s/r7sgebdtmzj14s/3301 this is full file, rename to ISO
[2013-01-05 17:15:30] <scrounger> I just mean, i listen to music, and i've never really heard a song like this.  like, what instruments are those (other than guitar)?
[2013-01-05 17:15:34] <lull> ty
[2013-01-05 17:15:41] <Gabriel_> I alredy said
[2013-01-05 17:15:48] <brotherBox> Just guitar I think. Any other opinions?
[2013-01-05 17:15:49] <Gabriel_> It's in g# key
[2013-01-05 17:15:54] <Gabriel_> Just a guitar
[2013-01-05 17:15:58] <Gabriel_> And in the end
[2013-01-05 17:16:10] <anon654154> im in strings(cello) and play guitar. im not good with getting hints with music though
[2013-01-05 17:16:17] <scrounger> Or, just the feeling from it: it's weird. i've never heard a song like this before.
[2013-01-05 17:16:30] <Gabriel_> Ok
[2013-01-05 17:16:33] <scrounger> like, the note combinations or something? sounds like middle eastern?
[2013-01-05 17:16:36] <Gabriel_> In the end of the song
[2013-01-05 17:16:39] <scrounger> or maybe indian
[2013-01-05 17:16:51] <onon> guitar and some sort of drums
[2013-01-05 17:16:56] <Gabriel_> You can heard some kind of weird drums
[2013-01-05 17:17:06] <sephiap> hmm, echo hiding steganography maybe?
[2013-01-05 17:17:11] <scrounger> exactly. they're WEIRD drums
[2013-01-05 17:17:21] <absolutezeroff> we can outguess the mp3 can't we
[2013-01-05 17:17:22] <scrounger> everything is WEIRD
[2013-01-05 17:17:25] <scrounger> that's my point
[2013-01-05 17:17:42] <Gabriel_> But, we think that maybe
[2013-01-05 17:17:45] <Gabriel_> That drums
[2013-01-05 17:17:55] <Gabriel_> Are some kind of morse code
[2013-01-05 17:18:01] <Gabriel_> Or some shit like that
[2013-01-05 17:18:06] <scrounger> whoa

[2013-01-05 17:23:04] <thaltbw> obviously we need to get characters from the book of law, would the character count start at 0, 1, 2...

[2013-01-05 17:23:05] <brotherBox> Lol
[2013-01-05 17:23:10] <thaltbw> or 1, 2, 3...?

[2013-01-05 17:23:30] <scrounger> OMFG THIS HAS BEEN SOLVED

[2013-01-05 17:23:40] <brotherBox> Nothing.
[2013-01-05 17:23:44] <brotherBox> Absolutely nothing.
[2013-01-05 17:23:55] <Cooper_> I apologize for not really following as well as I should. I really want to help solve this just as much as the next guy.
[2013-01-05 17:24:02] <Cooper_> I haven't slept at all last night though.
[2013-01-05 17:24:04] <Choncho> did we at least crack twitter?
[2013-01-05 17:24:07] <scrounger> Hey, I made a pretty sweet youtube video of the song, that's not "Absolutely nothing"
[2013-01-05 17:24:18] <brotherBox> I'm sorry.
[2013-01-05 17:24:28] <scrounger> lol, just messing around :)
[2013-01-05 17:24:41] <scrounger> Cooper, sorry man.  But it's been said about 100 ties.
[2013-01-05 17:24:44] <brotherBox> I'm just annoyed by how few people did a bit of work on the wiki. I guess because nobody bothers to read it in the first place.
[2013-01-05 17:24:52] <scrounger> So I was just frustrated.
[2013-01-05 17:25:11] <Cooper_> I understand the frustration. Everyone is on edge becasue of this.
[2013-01-05 17:25:17] <scrounger> Anyway, so here's a very relevant question: Why did they choose this book?
[2013-01-05 17:25:18] <Cooper_> because*

[2013-01-05 17:25:50] <onon> well its frustration going through the same old shit all over again bc new ppl are coming in constantly not knowing the status we're at
[2013-01-05 17:25:58] <onon> ^
[2013-01-05 17:25:59] <onon> yes
[2013-01-05 17:26:05] <absolutezeroff> oh ok
[2013-01-05 17:26:05] <scrounger> According to this: http://pastebin.com/RmqxWcnB, which granted we don't even know if it's legit... but a lot of people think it is, they say "a careful reading of the texts used in the contest would have revealed some of these beliefs"
[2013-01-05 17:26:07] <onon> ^^
[2013-01-05 17:26:10] <onon> np
[2013-01-05 17:26:17] <onon> check the wiki
[2013-01-05 17:26:31] <Lurker69> well usually they chose a books that are somehow relevant to cicdas "pholosophy" agrippa, merrage ioof heaven and hell, arthur and hily grail..
[2013-01-05 17:26:39] <scrounger> if absolutezeroff starts saying it's Agrippa Book of the Dead, I'm going to rip his throat out.
[2013-01-05 17:27:07] <absolutezeroff> It's Book of Law
[2013-01-05 17:27:12] <scrounger> (just messing with you absolutezeroff... and Cooper a little :) )
[2013-01-05 17:27:21] <scrounger> yes, thanks

[2013-01-05 17:28:10] <Lurker69> do tell
[2013-01-05 17:28:17] <absolutezeroff> Ah i'll just look at the Book of Law then
[2013-01-05 17:28:43] <Lurker69> http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/engccxx.htm link to the book
[2013-01-05 17:28:48] <scrounger> Have you guys read this? http://pastebin.com/dHJ6JNkr
[2013-01-05 17:28:51] <lull> on the song the first part is stongly spanish its classical spanish guitar music, and in the 2nd part its 100% indian,
[2013-01-05 17:29:21] <anon654154> second part is reversed *facepalm
[2013-01-05 17:29:33] <scrounger> but wait, anon...
[2013-01-05 17:29:34] <Lurker69> what is with theory that last part is first part played backwards
[2013-01-05 17:29:40] <Lurker69> was that confirmed
[2013-01-05 17:29:40] <scrounger> it totally sounds india
[2013-01-05 17:30:07] <Lurker69> some were saying something about reversing the song...  i dint follow exactly
[2013-01-05 17:30:10] <scrounger> so, even if it is reversed it still tells us that they wanted it to be 1) reversed, and 2) sound indian.

[2013-01-05 17:30:21] <Cooper_> a musical palindrome?
[2013-01-05 17:30:26] <scrounger> I mean, who the fuck merges spanish and indian music?
[2013-01-05 17:30:37] <Lurker69> but it would make sense since that rpime for tittwer is also reversed first hals in second half
[2013-01-05 17:30:41] <scrounger> no one does, other than cicada 3301
[2013-01-05 17:30:45] <lull> went to neigboursh :D some musicians
[2013-01-05 17:30:46] <Cooper_> We were seeing palindromes earlier.
[2013-01-05 17:31:12] <anon654154> idk exactly but people have been over this. the last part is not the first part reversed but more of the song reversed as far as people can tell
[2013-01-05 17:31:13] <Cooper_> God damn I feel like a retarded version of watson. -_-
[2013-01-05 17:31:15] <scrounger> exactly!  but it doesn't mean that the forwards part isn't intentional, right? so even if it's reversed, it's still spanish -> indian
[2013-01-05 17:31:17] <Lurker69> [09:24]	nadando	here's an audio file for you https://anonfiles.com/file/b4a0a572aa4e307facb9e75e37a364b5
[2013-01-05 17:31:17] <Lurker69> [09:24]	nadando	notice that it's palindromic

[2013-01-05 17:31:52] <scrounger> then the name of it is about a cicada moving onto another part of its lifecycle, right?
[2013-01-05 17:31:59] <Cooper_> Yes.
[2013-01-05 17:32:00] <scrounger> more transition

[2013-01-05 17:33:15] <Lurker69> thng is any such thingabout song being  palindromic shod  go to wiki for future reference
[2013-01-05 17:33:45] <Lurker69> because people are discoverying same stuf aevery two hourd, because nobody is writing down what he foinds
[2013-01-05 17:33:54] <onon> ^
[2013-01-05 17:34:04] <onon> brother is fixing that in the wiki atm
[2013-01-05 17:35:03] <Choncho> it is not spanish or indian
[2013-01-05 17:35:15] <anon654154> agreed
[2013-01-05 17:35:30] <lull> that part in 1:50 doesnt fit in
[2013-01-05 17:35:45] <lull> its like it doesnt belong to to song
[2013-01-05 17:35:56] <Choncho> the song reminds me a lot of songs from the 60's and early 70's
[2013-01-05 17:35:57] <absolutezeroff> anyway I'm going to solve the book code
[2013-01-05 17:35:59] <Cooper_> Finally. ubuntu finished installing on the VM >.<
[2013-01-05 17:36:22] <sephiap> is it just me or is the time signature jumping all over the place? not sure if that's too obscure though :/
[2013-01-05 17:37:16] <jayded1> I've heard that song before, just can't place it yet

[2013-01-05 17:40:30] <scrounger> shit, got disconnected,sorry
[2013-01-05 17:40:58] <absolutezeroff> I'm trying to solve the book code right now
[2013-01-05 17:41:02] <scrounger> anyway, what I was saying was that everything seems to be about transition: the song from one style to another, the numbers (and the song) from one direction to another, and so on.
[2013-01-05 17:41:14] <scrounger> then if you read this: http://pastebin.com/dHJ6JNkr
[2013-01-05 17:41:38] <scrounger> which, is admittedly a little wacked out, and not sure whether it's legit, a hint, or a troll
[2013-01-05 17:42:00] <scrounger> but the whole thing is about transition: the neitzche's ubermensch stuff, etc.
[2013-01-05 17:42:17] <scrounger> plus, "emergence"...
[2013-01-05 17:42:36] <scrounger> then the warning talks about an emergent global brain? (the heylighen thing, I gooogled it)
[2013-01-05 17:42:44] <scrounger> eery.
[2013-01-05 17:42:53] <scrounger> eerie
[2013-01-05 17:43:21] <sephiap> extremely so, but that reads entirely like fiction to me
[2013-01-05 17:43:41] <scrounger> fine. like i said, i have no clue how to even take that thing...
[2013-01-05 17:43:46] <madcone> got i
[2013-01-05 17:44:15] <absolutezeroff> hmm?
[2013-01-05 17:44:15] <scrounger> i'm just noticing that everything to do with cicada 3301 seems to, at least in a round-about way, deal in the concept of transition from one thing into another
[2013-01-05 17:45:03] <sephiap> normalising the audio, there is a really weird 'ssss' sound noticable before the guitar starts playing
[2013-01-05 17:45:14] <sephiap> also, in the spectral analysis, a weird blip around 15khz

[2013-01-05 17:45:38] <Cooper_> Seriously? We turning into some kind of Evangelion theories?
[2013-01-05 17:45:41] <brotherBox> I'm editing the wiki atm
[2013-01-05 17:45:51] <Cooper_> I doubt this is legit.
[2013-01-05 17:45:59] <absolutezeroff> Before I go further: has anyone solved the book code?
[2013-01-05 17:46:25] <brotherBox> GAH
[2013-01-05 17:46:25] <brotherBox> FUCKING GOD DAMN SHIT
[2013-01-05 17:46:26] <brotherBox> This can't be real
[2013-01-05 17:46:26] <brotherBox> Yes we did OH MY FUCKING GOD YES WE FUCKING DID
[2013-01-05 17:46:28] <absolutezeroff> ?
[2013-01-05 17:46:33] <touple> we did?
[2013-01-05 17:46:46] <scrounger> he has to be joking
[2013-01-05 17:46:53] <absolutezeroff> Okay then we should just work on twitter then
[2013-01-05 17:46:54] <brotherBox> It gave us the dropbox link to the image
[2013-01-05 17:47:04] <brotherBox> Or am I wrong here?
[2013-01-05 17:47:09] <brotherBox> Is there another book cipher?

[2013-01-05 17:47:23] <absolutezeroff> Yeah
[2013-01-05 17:47:34] <onon> here the summary of what we did so far, correct me if i missed something http://pastebin.com/fq9wHYKT
[2013-01-05 17:47:44] <absolutezeroff> What did the code say? I can't find it on wiki
[2013-01-05 17:48:00] <scrounger> OMFG. DUDE.  it was the dropbox link.
[2013-01-05 17:48:01] <brotherBox> absolutezeroff, I'm on it.
[2013-01-05 17:48:02] <Cooper_> It's being added.
[2013-01-05 17:48:08] <gentoomen> Anyone still here or has everyone given up?
[2013-01-05 17:48:09] <scrounger> Ok, anyway...
[2013-01-05 17:48:24] <scrounger> Ok, anyway...
[2013-01-05 17:48:25] <absolutezeroff> Okay now I know which order everything came in
[2013-01-05 17:48:47] <Gabriel_> I'm still heree
[2013-01-05 17:48:53] <scrounger> So reading through wikipedia about book of the law, we come to the section "Interpretation of Liber Legis"
[2013-01-05 17:49:05] <scrounger> which says "The emancipation of mankind from all limitations whatsoever is one of the main precepts of the Book"
[2013-01-05 17:49:11] <Gabriel_> Umm
[2013-01-05 17:49:29] <scrounger> sounds very cicada-like as far as freedom and whatnot.  but even more importantly, that is exactly what the ubermensch is about.
[2013-01-05 17:49:33] <Gabriel_> The pastebin of the guy who "worked" in cicada says something like that
[2013-01-05 17:50:18] <scrounger> exactly. that's what i'm referring to.
[2013-01-05 17:50:43] <scrounger> I'm just saying, there are some interesting themes here we should be looking at too (and noting in the wiki, perhaps?)
[2013-01-05 17:50:58] <brotherBox> http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/What_We_Know

[2013-01-05 17:53:35] <anon654154> "-" meant / in a url
[2013-01-05 17:53:36] <brotherBox> Was it? I can't remember. I was quite busy since them.

[2013-01-05 17:54:25] <anon654154> yeah it was. there was a line that read every letter of the book was perferct and literal
[2013-01-05 17:54:41] <anon654154> or along those lines, so we followed it
[2013-01-05 17:54:50] <brotherBox> Spaces as well?

[2013-01-05 17:54:57] <brotherBox> I don't think so about spaces.
[2013-01-05 17:56:39] <Lurker69> brotherBox:  dont forget to include https://pastee.org/ujpxy in that artivcle
[2013-01-05 17:57:00] <Lurker69> it is from mp3 file opened in txt viewer or hex
[2013-01-05 17:57:04] <brotherBox> Yes.
[2013-01-05 17:57:19] <brotherBox> I will, I just wanted to shut down the most urgent questions.
[2013-01-05 17:57:23] <Lurker69> i still dont know is that data in standard ID3 format or not
[2013-01-05 17:57:35] <brotherBox> I don't think so. I never heard of \n in ID3
[2013-01-05 17:57:41] <brotherBox> But that doesn't need to mean much.
[2013-01-05 17:57:43] <Lurker69> can you add plaintext to every mp3 in header and it plays ok
[2013-01-05 17:57:49] <brotherBox> You could fill books with what I don't know.
[2013-01-05 17:57:54] <Lurker69> or you need some special magic to do that
[2013-01-05 17:58:42] <Lurker69> i know  a thnk about img formant but not  a shit about how audio files work
[2013-01-05 17:59:54] <onon> lurker you can rape mp3s pretty deep
[2013-01-05 18:00:16] <onon> its pretty much like interpreted syntax only without real logic
[2013-01-05 18:00:32] <onon> just number values that turn out as waves forms

[2013-01-05 18:35:51] <Cuboid3301> And about the twitter code, our best bet is for the twitterbot to run its course. I believe that it will end once its Hex value reaches 3301

[2013-01-05 18:36:50] <Gabriel_> We've to decode the tw messages
[2013-01-05 18:36:52] <Gabriel_> And fast
[2013-01-05 18:37:03] <lull> why so?
[2013-01-05 18:37:31] <lull> time limited?
[2013-01-05 18:37:37] <Cooper_> Like I said before. I have a strong feeling that it's like a timer.
[2013-01-05 18:38:10] <Gabriel_> Me too
[2013-01-05 18:38:18] <Anon654154> it probably is, so be need to figure out what is has to do with the rest of this!
[2013-01-05 18:38:24] <absolutezeroff> the hex value is increasing by 41 (hex) at a time
[2013-01-05 18:38:27] <Cuboid3301> Do you have any evidence to at least hint towards that being true cooper_?
[2013-01-05 18:38:34] <absolutezeroff> which is 65 in decimal
[2013-01-05 18:39:53] <Cooper_> I don't have any evidence sorry, but that number at the front is getting higher and higher. And with the length of the digits, that somewhat indicates that it has to end somewhere.
[2013-01-05 18:39:55] <brotherBox> We had this discussion a million times before.
[2013-01-05 18:40:06] <brotherBox> Its hex(number_of_tweets * 65)
[2013-01-05 18:40:30] <brotherBox> That is it. The length of each message is 130 characters, or, in byte, 65.
[2013-01-05 18:40:53] <brotherBox> I tried to do a filetype analysis based on the first 65 byte, but no match for "file"
[2013-01-05 18:40:56] <absolutezeroff> Oh ok
[2013-01-05 18:41:15] <lull> so it means we have 5 mins time for cypher it?
[2013-01-05 18:41:16] <brotherBox> Efficiently, they send over a kilobyte of data so far.
[2013-01-05 18:41:17] <Cooper_> 0001aea:    <------- What happens when those numbers reach the highest?
[2013-01-05 18:41:37] <lull> i guess its the same shit everytime but its timed we have 5 mins per 1
[2013-01-05 18:42:49] <Anon654154> we need more codemonkeys from /g/. that might speed up the process
[2013-01-05 18:43:09] <Cuboid3301> Well with it being an 8 digit value maximum that we believe to increase by 41 hex each 5 minutes we still have an excessive amount of time to wait
[2013-01-05 18:43:14] <thaltbw> that will take years
[2013-01-05 18:43:25] <thaltbw> until it reaches fffffff
[2013-01-05 18:44:22] <derpman>  did anyone check the twitter prfile picture with outguess?
[2013-01-05 18:44:24] <Cuboid3301> We dont currently know what will happen, or if it can/will reach that far.
[2013-01-05 18:44:47] <Cuboid3301> It is a .png file so you are unable to
[2013-01-05 18:44:52] <Cooper_> Went back to reading more on that "3301 Cicada warning" paste and the way they described the organization made it sound a hell of a lot like cerberus from Mass Effect...
[2013-01-05 18:45:00] <derpman> really? is that just a limit of outguess?
[2013-01-05 18:45:50] <Cuboid3301> I don't understand how outguess works so I can't explain, all i know is it doesn't work with .png
[2013-01-05 18:45:51] <Cooper_> I think it has more to do with how things are hidden in jpg images.
[2013-01-05 18:46:08] <Cooper_> Outguess can only look for things hidden in a certain way.
[2013-01-05 18:46:15] <derpman> k
[2013-01-05 18:46:20] <Cooper_> And certain methods only work on certain filetypes.

[2013-01-05 18:48:09] <Lurker69> not 100% sure but i think that no stego tool can hide data efectively in png files
[2013-01-05 18:48:16] <absolutezeroff> Tweets remind me of a hash of some sort
[2013-01-05 18:48:36] <Lurker69> png filrs are basicali like bitmapsand it ie easy to spot a pixel that dont belong there

[2013-01-05 18:49:36] <Cuboid3301> So Lurker69, what are we able to do with the .png id there is anything possible

[2013-01-05 18:52:15] <lull> The smallest of three consecutive prime numbers that are also consecutive lucky numbers. Anything to do with this?
[2013-01-05 18:52:35] <absolutezeroff> I think we should analyze the phrase "The key is all around you."
[2013-01-05 18:53:25] <Anon654154> the music is the key and it surrounds you
[2013-01-05 18:53:30] <Gabriel_> The key is all around you." I think is about the song
[2013-01-05 18:53:32] <Cuboid3301> We have, our problem is we can't figure it out
[2013-01-05 18:53:34] <derpman> yeah, that, pus the use of the word circumferences jumped out at me
[2013-01-05 18:53:42] <Gabriel_> And the song is in Key G#
[2013-01-05 18:54:08] <Cooper_> What if we were to reply to their tweet with the "key"?
[2013-01-05 18:54:18] <thaltbw> I checked for radius and diameter of a circle with circumference of that large number
[2013-01-05 18:54:31] <thaltbw> and neither seemed significant
[2013-01-05 18:54:32] <lull> cooper that might wotk

[2013-01-05 18:56:23] <derpman> we really need to figure out what damn key the song is actually in
[2013-01-05 18:56:37] <Cooper_> I have an analysis tool that can tell.
[2013-01-05 18:56:44] <Cooper_> Let me run it through that.
[2013-01-05 18:56:54] <Cooper_> (read: virtual DJ)
[2013-01-05 18:56:57] <derpman> it may mean nothing, but it will squash that debate

[2013-01-05 18:57:41] <absolutezeroff> G# could be equated to 8, C# could be equated to 2
[2013-01-05 18:57:46] <Cooper_> VDJ says it's in G#m
[2013-01-05 18:58:20] <Anon654154> where does that leave us?
[2013-01-05 18:59:01] <Cooper_> I know I was one of the people that advocated for the key of the song being the "key" but I'm doubting that theory now.

[2013-01-05 19:00:17] <Cooper_> I believe there may be something in the file we are missing, but I am doubtful it is within the music itself.
[2013-01-05 19:00:21] <Gabriel_> Exactly
[2013-01-05 19:00:32] <NikTitanik> maybe the chords in the song represent a message?
[2013-01-05 19:00:39] <Gabriel_> I still think that theres a morse code hidden on the song
[2013-01-05 19:00:57] <Anon654154> the chords and notes are too intertwined to make a clear message
[2013-01-05 19:01:00] <onon> lel vdj

[2013-01-05 19:04:09] <brotherBox> I protected the wiki page.
[2013-01-05 19:04:23] <Cooper_> VDJ hasn't steered me wrong before when looking up the key of a song, so I trust it on this one.
[2013-01-05 19:04:33] <onon> https://anonfiles.com/file/ba418a7a5c182a4ff10491b6ae75e9fc here
[2013-01-05 19:04:58] <brotherBox> If you want to have something added, please let me know. I'll be back in an hour. Reasonings of the key the audio is in MUST be reasoned.
[2013-01-05 19:05:03] <onon> its the base note played on a piano put under the song with screenshot
[2013-01-05 19:05:20] <brotherBox> onon, how long will you stay?
[2013-01-05 19:05:28] <sephiap> this song is being played in drop d tuning, I do not think it's G#
[2013-01-05 19:05:30] <onon> dunno maybe another hour
[2013-01-05 19:05:47] <brotherBox> I'll hope to be back then. Is it okay if I leave you "in charge" until then?
[2013-01-05 19:05:55] <onon> sure
[2013-01-05 19:05:57] <Cooper_> onon, you made a good point there. I think you're right about the key being C# now.

[2013-01-05 19:11:27] <onon> im playing guitar bass for 12 yrs and piano 16+
[2013-01-05 19:11:42] <sephiap> and what, I've played guitar for 15 years, what does that even mean
[2013-01-05 19:11:58] <Cooper_> Can we get back on topic?
[2013-01-05 19:12:01] <onon> ^
[2013-01-05 19:12:11] <Cooper_> I think it's been established that the key of the song is not the "key"
[2013-01-05 19:12:18] <onon> i dont even think it means that much
[2013-01-05 19:12:21] <Gabriel_> Ok

[2013-01-05 19:12:47] <Cooper_> I think we are past the song for now though.
[2013-01-05 19:12:56] <Cooper_> It may become useful latert on but we need more pieces.
[2013-01-05 19:13:07] <Cooper_> I think we're better off focusing our efforts on the tweets.

[2013-01-05 19:13:37] <onon> ^
[2013-01-05 19:13:49] <onon> but thats just another number in a long array of fkn numbers
[2013-01-05 19:14:12] <onon> and its just three digits so hard to make out a pattern
[2013-01-05 19:14:20] <onon> harder than the text in the mp3 for example
[2013-01-05 19:15:13] <Cooper_> I have an idea of what the digits before the colon are supposed to represent.
[2013-01-05 19:15:47] <Anon654154> what?
[2013-01-05 19:15:48] <Cooper_> I'm sorry if I wind up taking us even further from the truth, but I feel like I need to brainstorm and get this out here.
[2013-01-05 19:16:07] <Cooper_> What if the twitter account has been giving us the same message over and over again
[2013-01-05 19:16:08] <Cooper_> ?
[2013-01-05 19:16:09] <Anon654154> sure, realy it cant hurt. were blind as it is
[2013-01-05 19:16:20] <Gabriel_> Could somebody gave me the song download link?
[2013-01-05 19:16:25] <Anon654154> maybe
[2013-01-05 19:16:28] <Gabriel_> Maybe, cooper
[2013-01-05 19:16:32] <lull> cooper i said tht like 30 mins ago
[2013-01-05 19:16:37] <Gabriel_> But then again

[2013-01-05 19:16:47] <Cooper_> But the digits before the colon are being used as a "seed" of some sort to change the cipher.
[2013-01-05 19:16:54] <Cooper_> You did lull?
[2013-01-05 19:16:58] <Anon654154> all the links are there http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGMrmsWxQ5E

[2013-01-05 19:17:20] <lull> i think we have 5 mins to decyper it
[2013-01-05 19:17:31] <Gabriel_> We haven't figured out any of the tweet
[2013-01-05 19:17:31] <onon> btw sephiap dont we mean the same when you say Dm and me C# ?

[2013-01-05 19:18:14] <onon> so what were we arguing about lol
[2013-01-05 19:18:21] <Cooper_> hehe
[2013-01-05 19:18:24] <sephiap> bwecause they're not the same key
[2013-01-05 19:18:59] <onon> as in chord its played it
[2013-01-05 19:19:20] <sephiap> that bass note is a D, not a C#
[2013-01-05 19:19:23] <Cooper_> So the "seed" is 7 digits long. An odd number.
[2013-01-05 19:19:57] <Cooper_> Odd in that, if I'm not mistaken, hex values are in pairs right?
[2013-01-05 19:20:03] <onon> ok no then i disagree
[2013-01-05 19:20:14] <onon> whatever though

[2013-01-05 19:46:01] <Cooper_> No.
[2013-01-05 19:46:16] <Cooper_> It's looping in the background in a VM on my machine as we speak.
[2013-01-05 19:46:41] <NikTitanik> maybe after a certain amount of loops something will happen

[2013-01-05 19:47:51] <Cooper_> I think we saw something like that elsewhere.

[2013-01-05 20:37:01] <lull> Find the divinity within and emerge.
[2013-01-05 20:37:07] <lull> could mean religion?

[2013-01-05 20:38:07] <wet> your self
[2013-01-05 20:38:14] <wet> that' what I think

[2013-01-05 20:38:33] <Cooper_> We reached the end of it not too long ago to be honest.
[2013-01-05 20:38:47] <lull> well might be mayan then
[2013-01-05 20:39:14] <lull> the book was telling about egypt
[2013-01-05 20:39:17] <Gabriel_> hats up guys
[2013-01-05 20:39:20] <Cooper_> And I listened to the 3301 notes on wolfram alpha.
[2013-01-05 20:39:21] <wet> i think that the mayan cycle was used only as a cypher
[2013-01-05 20:39:24] <onon> looking back at the other cicada puzzles i guess the solution is less in the sense of the words itself than hidden in some kind of pattern within them
[2013-01-05 20:39:37] <wet> Like or not it comes down to the twitter's countdown
[2013-01-05 20:39:46] <Cooper_> Sounds like the blues scale.

[2013-01-05 20:40:03] <onon> shit i dont wanna go to sleep lol
[2013-01-05 20:40:08] <Cooper_> a pattern within?
[2013-01-05 20:40:09] <lull> song was spanish / indian
[2013-01-05 20:40:10] <Cooper_> Hmm.
[2013-01-05 20:40:14] <wet> it decides everything
[2013-01-05 20:40:21] <Cooper_> Kinda like how people thought of outguess?
[2013-01-05 20:40:27] <onon> ^
[2013-01-05 20:40:29] <onon> exactly that
[2013-01-05 20:40:31] <Cooper_> on the picture with the duck
[2013-01-05 20:40:38] <onon> like converting them to numbers, anagrams, mirroring the words
[2013-01-05 20:41:07] <Cooper_> Okay, We might be onto something. Any tools that anyone can think of that might have any of those words in the name?
[2013-01-05 20:41:21] <wet> if you can't code get out now
[2013-01-05 20:41:21] <lull> egypt mayan spanish indian in every clue there is been  a specific country/culture
[2013-01-05 20:41:25] <Gabriel_> What's up guys, any news?
[2013-01-05 20:41:32] <wet> cause that is the part where you put mind to the test
[2013-01-05 20:42:21] <wet> twitter is testing the processing power of your mind
[2013-01-05 20:42:41] <lull> i can try out anagrams
[2013-01-05 20:43:30] <wet> the answer has been given, but we don't understand it yet

[2013-01-05 20:45:20] <yezae> wow.. just woke up, reading through logs
[2013-01-05 20:45:34] <wet> pay no attention to me though
[2013-01-05 20:45:36] <yezae> everything seems to get exciting when brotherbox is around
[2013-01-05 20:45:41] <wet> I need another beer
[2013-01-05 20:45:47] <brotherBox> yezae, I wonder why too
[2013-01-05 20:45:53] <brotherBox> Its not like I can do anything
[2013-01-05 20:46:11] <yezae> your thought process is flawlessly logic
[2013-01-05 20:46:18] <yezae> logical*
[2013-01-05 20:46:37] <brotherBox> Lol you must confuse me with...um...everyone here

[2013-01-05 20:47:25] <anon069> welcome back yezaee
[2013-01-05 20:47:33] <Cooper_> I feel like that one has to have some kind of key. The simplicity in the patterns have to mean something.
[2013-01-05 20:47:47] <brotherBox> The a4a5 seems to be a unique permutation of the pattern
[2013-01-05 20:48:04] <Cooper_> What is the numberical value of the 28a?
[2013-01-05 20:48:12] <anon069> could it be like punctuation or something?
[2013-01-05 20:48:13] <Cooper_> the part at the beginning before the colon?
[2013-01-05 20:48:19] <anon069> the a4a5
[2013-01-05 20:48:35] <brotherBox> I have absolutely no idea how an encryption would result in that ciphertext without immense similarities between the key and the plaintext.
[2013-01-05 20:48:39] <Cooper_> No, I meant my part..
[2013-01-05 20:48:43] <onon> a29268 too
[2013-01-05 20:48:50] <anon069> hmmm.
[2013-01-05 20:48:56] <anon069> that seems somewhat likely
[2013-01-05 20:49:21] <onon> god i cant even dicipher numbers anymore
[2013-01-05 20:49:30] <onon> 29296
[2013-01-05 20:49:32] <yezae> could it be integers
[2013-01-05 20:49:33] <thaltbw> My twitter theory is that it's like a a stream cipher, like an authenticator/token
[2013-01-05 20:49:50] <thaltbw> the key changes when twitter updates
[2013-01-05 20:50:03] <anon069> whats at the same step as the twitter? in other words, how far minus the twitter are we?
[2013-01-05 20:50:09] <anon069> they prolly corrispond
[2013-01-05 20:50:17] <brotherBox> thaltbw, I couldn't find anything resulting to a "proper" file header.
[2013-01-05 20:50:32] <anon069> but the key updates numerically

[2013-01-05 20:50:48] <anon069> it increases, but the cipher is seemingly random
[2013-01-05 20:51:06] <primius> I feel like a weak CBC-style cipher could cause patterns like this
[2013-01-05 20:51:11] <yezae> has anyone tried converting in python from hex to int?
[2013-01-05 20:51:12] <lull> well ill get drunk while at this, might get some good results
[2013-01-05 20:51:16] <Cooper_> CBC style?
[2013-01-05 20:51:21] <brotherBox> No key derivation
[2013-01-05 20:51:31] <brotherBox> Basically the same key applied to different blocks.
[2013-01-05 20:51:37] <brotherBox> Iirc
[2013-01-05 20:51:39] <primius> if one were to encode 0s with xor, taking the output of the previous block as the key for the current block
[2013-01-05 20:51:42] <nadando> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation#Cipher-block_chaining_.28CBC.29
[2013-01-05 20:51:46] <bakpak2hvy> morning guys
[2013-01-05 20:51:49] <primius> the first block would simply repeat, as we are seeing here
[2013-01-05 20:52:16] <primius> I think it's also interesting that the period in this case is 4 bytes, or 32 bits, a common key length

[2013-01-05 21:48:52] <wet> well since the .iso had showed the Fibonacci sequence before revealing the twitter, I'm thinking it is tied in some how to the deciphering of the tweets

[2013-01-05 21:58:10] <lull> like 3301
[2013-01-05 21:58:17] <lull> 1033 might be second
[2013-01-05 21:58:35] <NikTitanik> 761 third?

[2013-01-05 22:00:08] <Anon654154> the tweets must be generated by something, a program or something. The automated 5min intervals and the precise pattern. its not a person.

[2013-01-05 22:45:46] <lull> this year might be mathematical?
[2013-01-05 22:45:52] <lull> Both produce the MD5 hash 79054025255fb1a26e4bc422aef54eb4.[31] The difference between the two samples is the leading bit in each nibble has been flipped. For example, the 20th byte (offset 0x13) in the top sample, 0x87, is 10000111 in binary. The leading bit in the byte (also the leading bit in the first nibble) is flipped to make 00000111, which is 0x07 as shown in the lower sample.
[2013-01-05 22:46:28] <anon132> the tweets are 130 characters, not counting the 7 digit header
[2013-01-05 22:46:33] <lull> yeap
[2013-01-05 22:46:41] <lull> but this one is very very similar with it

[2013-01-06 00:53:16] <yezae> we could be looking at something like this
[2013-01-06 00:53:23] <sr01> quite possible
[2013-01-06 00:53:28] <Sunshine_> So do you think only half of the palindrome is a password/phone number/ whatever?
[2013-01-06 00:54:01] <bakpak2hvy> if we get some phone numbers ill call them
[2013-01-06 00:54:30] <sr01> bakpak, try logging in

[2013-01-06 00:58:29] <Daomos> this may mean nothing
[2013-01-06 00:59:14] <sr01> i'm waiting
[2013-01-06 00:59:16] <bakpak2hvy> i thought the book of law didnt mean anything when i found it, but it turned out to be the book for the cipher
[2013-01-06 00:59:17] <Daomos> but what if the number at the beginning of the tweets is a hex color swatch
[2013-01-06 00:59:24] <bakpak2hvy> cant be
[2013-01-06 00:59:25] <bakpak2hvy> i dont think
[2013-01-06 00:59:30] <bakpak2hvy> those are 6 characters
[2013-01-06 01:00:08] <Daomos> oh yeah
[2013-01-06 01:00:12] <bakpak2hvy> they are some kind of hex something, though

[2013-01-06 01:01:30] <Lurker69> bakpak2hvy: how did you get idea about book od law?
[2013-01-06 01:01:30] <gentoomen> I just haven't had anything to say
[2013-01-06 01:01:36] <bakpak2hvy> wikipedia
[2013-01-06 01:01:39] <Lurker69> inb4 bakpak is a cicada
[2013-01-06 01:01:43] <bakpak2hvy> i googled "dictated to a beast"
[2013-01-06 01:01:44] <bakpak2hvy> lol
[2013-01-06 01:01:57] <Sunshine_> What were the numbers again?
[2013-01-06 01:02:06] <bakpak2hvy> i think lull had them
[2013-01-06 01:02:22] <Sunshine_> Anus
[2013-01-06 01:02:23] <lull> im still lurkin
[2013-01-06 01:02:28] <lull> what numbs u wanted?
[2013-01-06 01:02:32] <Sunshine_> I think you may be onto something with the color swatches
[2013-01-06 01:02:34] <bakpak2hvy> ask Sunshine_
[2013-01-06 01:02:58] <lull> anushine what you want?
[2013-01-06 01:03:18] <bakpak2hvy> lol anushine
[2013-01-06 01:03:19] <Sunshine_> Didn't someone say something about the numbers being 6 digits long and ending in f?
[2013-01-06 01:03:28] <Sunshine_> They could be a color
[2013-01-06 01:03:41] <nadando> no
[2013-01-06 01:03:47] <nadando> 7 digits
[2013-01-06 01:03:58] <lull> yeap its 7 everytime
[2013-01-06 01:04:04] <Sunshine_> Damn...
[2013-01-06 01:04:13] <Sunshine_> Is there a similar number we can cast out?
[2013-01-06 01:04:22] <lull> 0
[2013-01-06 01:04:32] <Daomos> yup 0
[2013-01-06 01:04:37] <Sunshine_> Maybe we can take that out and it becomes a color
[2013-01-06 01:04:41] <Sunshine_> Do they all end in f?
[2013-01-06 01:04:42] <lull> try it
[2013-01-06 01:04:43] <Sunshine_> F
[2013-01-06 01:04:58] <bakpak2hvy> is there a common string in all the texts?
[2013-01-06 01:05:04] <sr01> no
[2013-01-06 01:05:12] <bakpak2hvy> the longer we dont figure something out the more tweets we have to sift through
[2013-01-06 01:05:36] <lull> 184 wont be impossible
[2013-01-06 01:06:01] <Sunshine_> Is there something about a 761 in the numbers?
[2013-01-06 01:06:04] <Sunshine_> Anywhere?
[2013-01-06 01:06:05] <lull> but if im right about the connection to hash crypts, they will end under 900
[2013-01-06 01:06:08] <sephiap> what if all the tweets contain the same messages but are encrypting using the incremental ID as a seed?
[2013-01-06 01:06:19] <lull> might be
[2013-01-06 01:06:37] <bakpak2hvy> 761 is prime
[2013-01-06 01:06:39] <lull> so we have to start from 1st post?
[2013-01-06 01:06:41] <bakpak2hvy> dont think its relevant
[2013-01-06 01:06:54] <lull> and we have 5 mins time to go thru 185 posts?
[2013-01-06 01:07:09] <lull> its like b counting
[2013-01-06 01:07:16] <lull> never succees
[2013-01-06 01:07:19] <sephiap> haha
[2013-01-06 01:07:22] <Sunshine_> We did get to 75 once.
[2013-01-06 01:07:29] <lull> :D
[2013-01-06 01:07:35] <lull> never forget
[2013-01-06 01:07:44] <Sunshine_> I will nevar forget that.
[2013-01-06 01:07:58] <Sunshine_> Mostly because I nearly shit myself in my chair
[2013-01-06 01:08:02] <bakpak2hvy> nevar forget frog in space
[2013-01-06 01:08:12] <sephiap> seriously though, that if there is some encryption like sha1 or similar that is being fed 0002eb8 etc on the same string
[2013-01-06 01:08:19] <absolutezeroff> i'm going to speed-learn python-twitter
[2013-01-06 01:08:31] <absolutezeroff> so we can automate parts of our tweet sifting
[2013-01-06 01:08:33] <Sunshine_> Yeah, I won't be much help there.
[2013-01-06 01:08:35] <sephiap> resulting in an encrypted string of the same length, different string but the same content
[2013-01-06 01:08:36] <bakpak2hvy> i dont know any programming shit
[2013-01-06 01:08:40] <bakpak2hvy> i can do some bash stuff
[2013-01-06 01:08:47] <bakpak2hvy> and i kick ass at webpage markup
[2013-01-06 01:08:49] <bakpak2hvy> but no programming
[2013-01-06 01:09:01] <Sunshine_> I'll be moral support when it comes to programming.
[2013-01-06 01:09:16] <sephiap> it would make sense that this bot is churning out all the permutations on this incrementing key in order to help us work it out?
[2013-01-06 01:09:17] <lull> and ill be a logical thinker
[2013-01-06 01:09:31] <sephiap> much like how keygens are reverse engineered(?)
[2013-01-06 01:09:50] * sephiap gets his statistical analysis book off the shelf
[2013-01-06 01:10:12] <sephiap> ok see you guys later, will see if anything comes of this
[2013-01-06 01:10:27] <Sunshine_> Good lucj

[2013-01-06 03:29:47] <Lurker69> We strongly suggest that you avoid configuring your channel to "auto-op". Use the chanserv "op" command to obtain channel operator status only when needed. This will help to keep your channel temperature low and reduce conflicts.  from freenode help page lol
[2013-01-06 03:30:11] <Lurker69> where is the list of all possible modes and flags?

[2013-01-06 03:50:54] <Lurker69> like it is more polite id ops dont have  @ and  use it onle when they need it

[2013-01-06 03:53:28] <bakpak2hvy> but who cares? this is the only chan ive ever been an op in i dont feel any different
[2013-01-06 03:53:42] <bakpak2hvy> no offense to anyone who may feel different, but i dont see what the big deal is

[2013-01-06 03:54:30] <sr01_> its only an issue if you start randomly banning

[2013-01-06 04:09:06] <immortalghost> why cant i just leave?
[2013-01-06 04:09:07] <Lurker69> we need to organize wiki a bit more  and add section with "TO DO LIST" or something where people can check what is new
[2013-01-06 04:09:15] <immortalghost> why am i interested inv this shit
[2013-01-06 04:09:18] <bakpak2hvy> Lurker69: im on it
[2013-01-06 04:09:46] <bakpak2hvy> i declare myself secretary of the wiki
[2013-01-06 04:09:51] <bakpak2hvy> if you guys are cool with it
[2013-01-06 04:09:52] <Lurker69> also we could put update bot in cahnnel, he could log all chat also
[2013-01-06 04:10:12] <Lurker69> but i dont know hw to, nor i can run bot on my box
[2013-01-06 04:10:20] <xx-pyro> what server is this
[2013-01-06 04:10:25] <Lurker69> freenode
[2013-01-06 04:10:28] <bakpak2hvy> im not good at bots
[2013-01-06 04:10:32] <bakpak2hvy> dont pick me
[2013-01-06 04:10:41] <bakpak2hvy> we should come up with a cool name for it, though
[2013-01-06 04:11:11] <Lurker69> we dont pick anybody, if we would need it i can move the bot we have on #arg here, but i need to get his owner
[2013-01-06 04:11:15] <n_factor> my instinct is to use the 0000000: as an offset
[2013-01-06 04:11:28] <n_factor> since each string is 41 (hex) bytes long
[2013-01-06 04:11:31] <n_factor> on the twitter
[2013-01-06 04:11:34] <Lurker69> ^ makes sense
[2013-01-06 04:11:49] <bakpak2hvy> ^this
[2013-01-06 04:11:53] <n_factor> so its one long file we are slowly receiving
[2013-01-06 04:12:23] <immortalghost> thats what i was thinking. like how the last one made us wait
[2013-01-06 04:12:25] <brotherBox> ^
[2013-01-06 04:12:28] <n_factor> yeah
[2013-01-06 04:12:43] <immortalghost> but how long is it?
[2013-01-06 04:12:59] <immortalghost> 222 tweets so far
[2013-01-06 04:13:10] <n_factor> so the idea is to figure out the encryption while its streaming
[2013-01-06 04:13:11] <bakpak2hvy> how long do we wait?
[2013-01-06 04:13:13] <pr0> jesus it could take forever
[2013-01-06 04:13:18] <bakpak2hvy> pr0: its going to

[2013-01-06 04:22:44] <bakpak2hvy> from last year
[2013-01-06 04:22:56] <bakpak2hvy> you got that when you opened final.jpg in notepad or something instead of outguess
[2013-01-06 04:23:31] <Lurker69> clue was  presented  in a way that it wasnt exactly apparent, but apparently somebody connected it to outguess

[2013-01-06 04:41:06] <sr01_> the three files in DATA
[2013-01-06 04:41:15] <sr01_> .00 .13 and .17
[2013-01-06 04:41:54] <bthemightyb_> what was the ending last year. is this one big joke?
[2013-01-06 04:42:24] <bakpak2hvy> no its not a joke
[2013-01-06 04:42:39] <xx-pyro> i tried extracting them
[2013-01-06 04:42:41] <xx-pyro> alread
[2013-01-06 04:42:42] <Cuboid3301> We have enough evidence to conclude that this is a legitimate 3301 Cicada Program
[2013-01-06 04:42:58] <pr0_> its legit
[2013-01-06 04:43:02] <xx-pyro> the isolinux.txt
[2013-01-06 04:43:09] <xx-pyro> literally says splash.rle
[2013-01-06 04:43:11] <xx-pyro> has anyone opened that
[2013-01-06 04:43:23] <bakpak2hvy> if someone can get the file to me i will
[2013-01-06 04:43:23] <Cuboid3301> I wonder if they boosted the difficulty this year and that is why no one can get it
[2013-01-06 04:43:42] <Cuboid3301> Because Last years seemed to be much easier
[2013-01-06 04:43:56] <bakpak2hvy> Cuboid3301: it was, but there was a lot of waiting
[2013-01-06 04:44:29] <pr0_> patience is a virtue
[2013-01-06 04:44:45] <bakpak2hvy> :D
[2013-01-06 04:44:53] <sr01_> tridnet cant detect the filetypes
[2013-01-06 04:44:59] <Cuboid3301> Cicada is evil.... How can they expect people from the internet to be patient haha
[2013-01-06 04:45:38] <bakpak2hvy> sr01_: for filetypes use file
[2013-01-06 04:45:41] <pr0_> So is this part of NWO?
[2013-01-06 04:46:07] <sr01_> file?
[2013-01-06 04:46:07] <pr0_> sounds like some sort of masonic group
[2013-01-06 04:46:09] <scrounger> this IS the NWO
[2013-01-06 04:46:21] <bakpak2hvy> currently 229 tweets
[2013-01-06 04:46:25] <bakpak2hvy> we need to figure something out
[2013-01-06 04:46:29] <sr01_> pr0, we are tracking you
[2013-01-06 04:46:31] <sr01_> no way back
[2013-01-06 04:46:49] <bakpak2hvy> i think the hex thing before the colon seems to have some sort of pattern once its in ASCII
[2013-01-06 04:46:53] <bakpak2hvy> or whatever its called
[2013-01-06 04:46:59] <pr0_> lol track me all ou want if ou are willing to cross an ocean to get to me
[2013-01-06 04:47:26] <bakpak2hvy> pr0_: everywhere
[2013-01-06 04:47:32] <Cuboid3301> Yeah, I have been trying to decode that by finding patters but when a letter takes the place of a number the pattern is disrupted
[2013-01-06 04:47:46] <pr0_> anways this is more interesting than rl
[2013-01-06 04:47:47] <sr01_> we have people everywhere

[2013-01-06 05:28:53] <Furtivity> Here is an idea on the 'parable' passage: what if 1,595,277,641 is an ISBN number? It would correspong to a book on Statistics and Data analysis, and the parable talks of "circumference"
[2013-01-06 05:29:00] <absolutezeroff> We can justify it because by using the book code it generated the cicada-related dropbox link

[2013-01-06 05:46:35] <absolutezeroff> I think the most convincing thing was that the numbers at the beginning are an offset
[2013-01-06 05:47:00] <absolutezeroff> should we post something to /g/?
[2013-01-06 05:47:09] <bakpak2hvy> not on /b/ again
[2013-01-06 05:47:11] <brohawkobama> ^NO
[2013-01-06 05:47:21] <bakpak2hvy> whoever started that thread should delete it soon
[2013-01-06 05:47:39] <Cuboid3301> absoluteseroff: They don't help. Usually too much of pussies.
[2013-01-06 05:47:53] <bakpak2hvy> what about /sci/?
[2013-01-06 05:48:06] <Furtivity> They are mocking the challenge
[2013-01-06 05:48:16] <Furtivity> They say its all a big hoax
[2013-01-06 05:48:23] <Cuboid3301> bakpak2hvy: I don't know. We have only one person from there and thats it.
[2013-01-06 05:49:43] <absolutezeroff> wouldn't /g/ be better than /b/ though
[2013-01-06 05:49:44] <Kenodox> we all know that the twitter posts end with a countup from 0-9 and then a-f, but what kind of code might that be?
[2013-01-06 05:50:01] <bthemightyb_> can we add this as active to argnet
[2013-01-06 05:50:05] <sr01_> looks like hex
[2013-01-06 05:50:07] <sr01_> isnt md5
[2013-01-06 05:50:13] <bthemightyb_> it would prolly attract pro attention

[2013-01-06 05:50:51] <Kenodox> i think the twitter posts are in hexadecimal

[2013-01-06 06:07:05] <absolutezeroff> 174 from 2 to 1033

[2013-01-06 06:11:20] <absolutezeroff> so how do we transcode it exactly
[2013-01-06 06:11:51] <Cuboid3301> Use the ANCII in the tweet and have 11 be the key.
[2013-01-06 06:12:00] <Cuboid3301> Maybe that is how it works

[2013-01-06 06:23:06] <n_factor> "Parable 1,595,277,641" is not part of the poem
[2013-01-06 06:23:12] <Kashue> perhaps a connection between pallendromes
[2013-01-06 06:23:47] <n_factor> it is truncated in the mp3 with x00

[2013-01-06 06:24:07] <Kenodox> what kind of poem is it? it does not follow the 5-7-5 haiku format, but it is close with a 6-7-6
[2013-01-06 06:24:20] <Kashue> 1033 3301 1231507051321
[2013-01-06 06:24:48] <bakpak2hvy> Kashue: i think that still counts as a haiku

[2013-01-06 06:30:29] <dafvffad> probably not, I would like to know the relevence of the descending @00x
[2013-01-06 06:30:40] <n_factor> what is the significance of Jan 5? Jan 5th is the 12th day of christmas and the eve of Epiphany.
[2013-01-06 06:30:41] <n_factor> in christian holidays
[2013-01-06 06:30:41] <n_factor> Epiphany has many symbols of diety coming from man, the birth of jesus, etc
[2013-01-06 06:30:41] <n_factor> also, "epiphany" is knowledge suddenly revealed as if from the divine in common parlance.
[2013-01-06 06:30:41] <n_factor> as in "i had an epiphany." a sudden realization from supernatural sources. both cicada puzzles started on Jan 5
[2013-01-06 06:30:57] <Anon404> The title of the tweets are generated with a different loop for each digit:

[2013-01-06 06:32:58] <bakpak2hvy> the dimensions of the image are definetly going to mean something eventually
[2013-01-06 06:32:58] <dafvffad> I mean that the first tweet is @0003cf0 and the last is @0000000, in a descending fashion
[2013-01-06 06:33:10] <absolutezeroff> it's in reverse chronological order
[2013-01-06 06:33:13] <Anon654154> i dont think the image size has much to do with anything bc its not both prime numbers crunch
[2013-01-06 06:33:20] <absolutezeroff> so i think 0000000 is the first

[2013-01-06 06:36:12] <Kashue> Lurker69: All these pallendromes maybe represent an idea or direction. "Like the instar, tunneling to the surface We must shed our own circumferences; Find the divinity within and emerge". Maybe the pallendrome theme represents a return to the start, a loop, a path/growth/rebirth from the start
[2013-01-06 06:36:33] <Anon654154> hey look at this link posted on 4chan http://regex.info/exif.cgi/exif.cgi?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.4chan.org%2Fb%2Fsrc%2F1357444835611.jpg

[2013-01-06 07:04:13] <Anon654154> we should focus on the iso more
[2013-01-06 07:04:29] <cooper_> There's no way it's random. Some of the earlier tweets had a specific pattern to them.
[2013-01-06 07:04:35] <bakpak2hvy> maybe we should wait out the twitter
[2013-01-06 07:04:36] <cooper_> No way they could be considered random.

[2013-01-06 07:04:49] <anonalaala> bakpak2hvy is 100% correct
[2013-01-06 07:04:51] <cooper_> Hang on. Let me find the tweet.
[2013-01-06 07:04:53] <dafvffad> It takes four posts before the a letter appears in the @XXXXX
[2013-01-06 07:05:00] <anonalaala> the tweets do seem to be pieces of a puzzle
[2013-01-06 07:05:01] <leakshmskill> well, we should start with the first twitter posts

[2013-01-06 07:05:21] <c4_> The parable number, it seems to be an ISBN. The page only says published December about it, but the site is recognizing 1,595,277,641 as an ISBN. You replace any of those numbers with a random number, it tells you it's not a valid ISBN. I think that's too much for a coincidence.

[2013-01-06 07:21:42] <leakshmskill> true, I knew David first
[2013-01-06 07:21:48] <leakshmskill> and he was beautiful
[2013-01-06 07:21:57] <primius> crash_demons: there's a custom ISO
[2013-01-06 07:22:05] <Kenodox> he was. But he was also very depressing
[2013-01-06 07:22:12] <primius> it's bootable and actually fucking works this time
[2013-01-06 07:22:25] <nadando> crash_demons: also a twitter feed https://twitter.com/1231507051321
[2013-01-06 07:22:32] <Kenodox> @primius for real?!?! thats great!
[2013-01-06 07:22:54] <crash_demons> hm, I'm kind of on a bandwidth diet, so that's going to be a problem for a while
[2013-01-06 07:23:03] <leakshmskill> alright, time to get back to business
[2013-01-06 07:23:12] <dafvffad> It was a reaction to the post-war Cristopher Ecc, everyone knows Tom Baker is the best doctor, but I digress, the poem has 32 syllables total
[2013-01-06 07:23:20] <Kenodox> the thread on /b/ got 404d
[2013-01-06 07:23:27] <leakshmskill> what should we be doing, what should I be doing?

[2013-01-06 07:25:03] <crash_demons> it was made for OTP22, but it could be usable here
[2013-01-06 07:25:03] <Kenodox> we should open up 5 more irc chats and separate all of the anons into 5 groups, one for each of the unsolved problems listed on the wiki. then we can have organised progress
[2013-01-06 07:25:04] <lolxD> primius: yep, already know that 664 prime number from 1 to 3301
[2013-01-06 07:25:26] <c4_> I agree with Kenodox, I am good with words, not numbers.
[2013-01-06 07:25:27] <lolxD> kenodox: sounds good
[2013-01-06 07:25:40] <leakshmskill> alright, I say we all delete system 32 and call it a night
[2013-01-06 07:25:50] <primius> and we should put all of the coders in a box together
[2013-01-06 07:25:51] <Anon404> 65 is the increment of each twitter post header, see my previous post
[2013-01-06 07:25:52] <lolxD> also, tried the caesar from -99 ~ +99, not good
[2013-01-06 07:26:01] <primius> so they can get shit done together
[2013-01-06 07:26:20] <Kenodox> yes, put all the coders together and all the riddlers together. All of us in the same channel is getting confusing
[2013-01-06 07:26:27] <Anon404> I agree

[2013-01-06 07:28:09] <dafvffad> I'm not sure whether it will be truly efficient to separate skills, as Cicada seems to combine everything in terms of meaning and manner
[2013-01-06 07:28:19] <alexanderthegrea> will do boss
[2013-01-06 07:28:20] <Anon404> okay

[2013-01-06 07:30:09] <dafvffad> I think phi is more poignant in this context, as it has the ties to divinity and change... the increments produce a heirarchy

[2013-01-06 07:39:29] <rrr> I got the codes by taking a random tweet from their twitter and converting it to binary from hex
[2013-01-06 07:39:40] <Lurker69> it is nothing bad.. until people started to conceal information from each other
[2013-01-06 07:39:59] * primius doesn't see anything bad about that
[2013-01-06 07:40:04] <leakshmskill> rrr: you want to go to coders?

[2013-01-06 07:40:17] <rrr> that'd be nice

[2013-01-06 08:03:43] <anonalaala> the translator online automatically translates from hex to binary AND normal text so... what he said makes no sense

[2013-01-06 08:07:50] <anonalaala> damn.  I was still on the golden ratio / fib idea
[2013-01-06 08:07:56] <anonalaala> the "KEY" is all around
[2013-01-06 08:08:10] <anonalaala> and when you look up the fib spiral (the divine ratio) there is a link to the OEIS
[2013-01-06 08:08:19] <anonalaala> http://oeis.org/A001622
[2013-01-06 08:08:21] <guest_____> around, round
[2013-01-06 08:08:23] <anonalaala> so the "KEY"
[2013-01-06 08:08:29] <anonalaala> might be A001622
[2013-01-06 08:08:38] <anonalaala> didn't OEIS get used earlier somehow
[2013-01-06 08:08:48] <cooper_> Now which kind of encryption is it so we can figure out how to use the key?
[2013-01-06 08:08:52] <anonalaala> but A001622 only has 7 digits :(

[2013-01-06 08:59:22] <lolxD> Mark__: I think that is the final piece to crack

[2013-01-06 08:59:39] <bthemightyb> everyone serious go do what you know you have to go do. get out of irc and and come back here tomorrow to reconvene?
[2013-01-06 08:59:42] <primius> Mark__: #3301hackers is focusing on that, they have a pad with relevant resources
[2013-01-06 09:01:06] <Absence_> just an idea
[2013-01-06 09:01:25] <bak|afk> alright
[2013-01-06 09:01:28] <bak|afk> now im afk for real
[2013-01-06 09:01:52] <Absence_> i believe each encryption that is sent out on twitter has a maximum lasting of 5 minutes, seeing as it keeps changing. I think you have to build something/find something that solves it within 5 minutes before it expires and a new one is created.

[2013-01-06 09:03:02] <brotherBox> Not very probable if you ask me. The problem with this theory is that you have a "header" which keeps displaying the amount of bytes send so far.

[2013-01-06 09:03:28] <Absence_> well decrypted it should be a message, crorect?
[2013-01-06 09:04:01] <Absence_> The message can be 65 bits but have different variations in small things, changing the total message you have to send back.
[2013-01-06 09:04:30] <brotherBox> If there is something like an encryption. Is there circumstantial evidence for that?

[2013-01-06 09:06:54] <Absence_> absolutezeroff: what if (during the boot process) you have to count out how many numbers till it reaches the first stopped number (cant recall what it is), and decode that specific one? the 2nd chance would it hits 3301
[2013-01-06 09:07:31] <absolutezeroff> 1033 was the first lol
[2013-01-06 09:07:33] <absolutezeroff> it's just 3301 backwards
[2013-01-06 09:08:02] <Absence_> How many numbers did it go through before 1033 appeared?
[2013-01-06 09:08:07] <absolutezeroff> http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=primes+from+2+to+1033
[2013-01-06 09:08:16] <absolutezeroff> 'primes from 2 to 1033' in wolfram
[2013-01-06 09:08:22] <absolutezeroff> 174 primes

[2013-01-06 09:08:42] <absolutezeroff> and from 2 to 3301, 464
[2013-01-06 09:08:43] <Absence_> so 174 encoded messages in
[2013-01-06 09:09:04] <absolutezeroff> i guess we can confirm whether this is the case by waiting it out and seeing if it stops at 464 tweets
[2013-01-06 09:09:18] <Absence_> or go back to the 174th tweet?
[2013-01-06 09:10:15] <absolutezeroff> i was hoping that i could get some help in decoding the tweets given cuboid's speculations
[2013-01-06 09:10:21] <absolutezeroff> it seems pretty concise
[2013-01-06 09:10:32] <absolutezeroff> 'the key is all around you' : all of those primes
[2013-01-06 09:10:39] <absolutezeroff> not concise, convincing sorry
[2013-01-06 09:10:57] <Absence_> Also
[2013-01-06 09:11:02] <Lurker69> bak|afk: ?
[2013-01-06 09:11:29] <Absence_> The pastebin posted, it spoke of Romans 10:13 -- whos to say that isnt another clue?
[2013-01-06 09:11:48] <Mark__>  ^ what did you have in mind?
[2013-01-06 09:11:59] <Absence_> "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
[2013-01-06 09:12:25] <absolutezeroff> I think that entire paste was a hoax
[2013-01-06 09:12:37] <absolutezeroff> because it didn't come from a source linked to the original image
[2013-01-06 09:12:41] <Absence_> As do I, but it could serve a purpose.
[2013-01-06 09:12:51] <Absence_> An alternate route, perhaps.
[2013-01-06 09:12:56] <Absence_> A hint in what to expect.
[2013-01-06 09:13:18] <lolxD> a least place to look for a hint, like that?
[2013-01-06 09:13:27] <Absence_> If it was anyone actually coming out of the 'program' or w/e, they would of exposed it fully and not warn you purposely questioning if it exists.
[2013-01-06 09:13:47] <Absence_> But if it isn't a hoax, it can be a path.

[2013-01-06 10:31:05] <Lesmo> Anyone has any news on the Twitter thing?
[2013-01-06 10:32:04] <zeke__> has anyone looked into the large data files that accompanied the iso?  i started but am quickly getting stumped
[2013-01-06 10:32:05] <anon654154> no
[2013-01-06 10:32:24] <Daomos> nope twitter still dumping numbers

[2013-01-06 10:34:32] <Lesmo> Ok... but is the theory of it containing a file in hex already discarded?
[2013-01-06 10:34:48] <Daomos> yeah i think
[2013-01-06 10:34:55] <Daomos> but i had an idea yesterday
[2013-01-06 10:35:29] <Daomos> do you know when you open a picture file using notepad
[2013-01-06 10:35:44] <Daomos> there is alod of numbers and letters
[2013-01-06 10:35:51] <Daomos> a load*
[2013-01-06 10:35:54] <Lesmo> Yes, yes.
[2013-01-06 10:36:07] <Daomos> maybe he is dumping the code to a picture flie
[2013-01-06 10:36:23] <Anon2595> the hivemind here is scary. I was actually just thinking something like that
[2013-01-06 10:36:37] <Anon2595> and each tweet is one part of the it
[2013-01-06 10:36:39] <Lesmo> Yeah, same thought I had few seconds ago.

[2013-01-06 10:37:00] <Lesmo> But I saw that in another way.
[2013-01-06 10:37:15] <Lesmo> Ever used a hex editor? Or anything like it?
[2013-01-06 10:37:22] <Lesmo> Looks more like it to me.

[2013-01-06 10:40:32] <[AFK]lolxD> nah it doesn't work
[2013-01-06 10:40:52] <Anon2595> should I include the part before the colon?
[2013-01-06 10:41:07] <[AFK]lolxD> I don't think so

[2013-01-06 10:41:10] <Lesmo> Well, file is not complete so of course it won't work. But may shed some light into what is it.
[2013-01-06 10:41:17] <Lesmo> No, don't include the colons
[2013-01-06 10:41:24] <Lesmo> Just everything after the colons
[2013-01-06 10:41:30] <Anon2595> alright.
[2013-01-06 10:41:37] <[AFK]lolxD> I think the clue lies on the head, it will open the way through the coded message

[2013-01-06 10:42:04] <Lurker69> isthere any reason why #33012013subgroupCoders isnt in topic?
[2013-01-06 10:42:04] <Daomos> maybe it is the same message in each tweet and the colon bit is telling us how to decode it maybe?
[2013-01-06 10:42:05] <[AFK]lolxD> not as major as the wikis

[2013-01-06 11:10:43] <bak|afk> im afk right now
[2013-01-06 11:10:47] <bak|afk> as you can probably tell
[2013-01-06 11:11:16] <lull> u got some yheory bout tweets?
[2013-01-06 11:11:25] <bak|afk> ive had a couple
[2013-01-06 11:11:30] <bak|afk> but none have worked
[2013-01-06 11:11:34] <lull> hmm
[2013-01-06 11:11:43] <bak|afk> there was someone working on it earlier. dont think they got anywhere, though.
[2013-01-06 11:11:52] <Absencelol> my friend sean to decode it
[2013-01-06 11:11:57] <Absencelol> still waiting for him to get back to me
[2013-01-06 11:12:04] <lull> k
[2013-01-06 11:12:04] <bak|afk> check oy the subchans. im going afk again.
[2013-01-06 11:12:07] <alexanderthegrea> i heard they figured out the pattern
[2013-01-06 11:12:16] <Daomos> what type of code do we think it is?
[2013-01-06 11:12:22] <bak|afk>  they got the prefix pattern, IIRC
[2013-01-06 11:12:29] <Absencelol> not confirmed
[2013-01-06 11:12:40] <Absencelol> sean said "im drunk and i can decode this LOL"
[2013-01-06 11:12:54] <CheeseFingers> perhaps something is palindromed?
[2013-01-06 11:13:13] <lull> hmm
[2013-01-06 11:13:21] <lull> if the 7 digit is a key
[2013-01-06 11:13:35] <jayded1> the prefix pattern is 1-9a-f going up by 41  eacch count
[2013-01-06 11:13:47] <lull> we should try out to find 130 bit keyd ciphers
[2013-01-06 11:14:43] <Absencelol> going afk
[2013-01-06 11:14:49] <Absencelol> if he tells me anything
[2013-01-06 11:14:50] <Absencelol> ill come right back
[2013-01-06 11:14:52] <lull> they used ceaser cipher before?
[2013-01-06 11:15:29] <Lurker69> they used cesasr at one puzzle
[2013-01-06 11:15:36] <alexanderthegrea> i think that's what they tried first

[2013-01-06 11:58:31] <lull> omg
[2013-01-06 11:58:32] <Lurker69> palindromes  three times
[2013-01-06 11:58:35] <Anon2595> Yeah, I pointed that out a while ago in the riddlers page
[2013-01-06 11:58:41] <immortalghost> so....
[2013-01-06 11:58:44] <Lurker69> 3301 1033, twitter and song
[2013-01-06 11:58:49] <immortalghost> do we palindrom the tweets?
[2013-01-06 11:59:19] <Lurker69> number in twitter adress is polin
[2013-01-06 11:59:31] <immortalghost> but the actual tweets
[2013-01-06 11:59:35] <bakpak2hvy> how many tweets did we predict there would be?
[2013-01-06 11:59:48] <Lurker69> 9000
[2013-01-06 11:59:50] <Lurker69> over

[2013-01-06 12:00:30] <bakpak2hvy> damn
[2013-01-06 12:00:33] <lull> what if we need to everything in reverse?
[2013-01-06 12:00:37] <lull> the poem
[2013-01-06 12:00:40] <lull> reverse it
[2013-01-06 12:00:48] <Daomos> wait this might be more likely 24392
[2013-01-06 12:00:49] <bakpak2hvy> is it palendrommic?
[2013-01-06 12:00:50] <Lurker69> yes some thing must be reversed for sure
[2013-01-06 12:01:10] <Lurker69> poem, tweets, or DATA files
[2013-01-06 12:01:34] <immortalghost> the song has reverse as welll
[2013-01-06 12:01:34] <alexanderthegrea> 464, was speculated to be the last tweet

[2013-01-06 12:02:23] <immortalghost> also wasnt 64 the increase?

[2013-01-06 12:02:35] <_cooper> lets see. considering that it is in hex, and that the header skips 41, I estimate that it could go on for 6547206 tweets
[2013-01-06 12:02:40] <bakpak2hvy> were exactly 150 tweets out
[2013-01-06 12:02:47] <bakpak2hvy> so if we end up being right
[2013-01-06 12:02:58] <bakpak2hvy> what if the whole thing is a palindrome, and thats how we solve it?
[2013-01-06 12:03:10] <bakpak2hvy> what if we already have enough information to do something with this?
[2013-01-06 12:03:19] <bakpak2hvy> lots of variables, i know
[2013-01-06 12:03:27] <immortalghost> well we'll have everything in 12 hours
[2013-01-06 12:03:33] <immortalghost> if its right

[2013-01-06 12:09:13] <Lurker69> bakpak2hvy: where you herd of it?  if page was used only 271 times

[2013-01-06 12:09:47] <bakpak2hvy> i dont think i ever visted it. maybe it was in a newsletter or something
[2013-01-06 12:09:52] <bakpak2hvy> or an index someplace
[2013-01-06 12:09:57] <Daomos> same
[2013-01-06 12:10:24] <Daomos> i think it has been around for about 2 years
[2013-01-06 12:10:43] <Lurker69> then 271 number is wrong
[2013-01-06 12:10:52] <Daomos> probally not
[2013-01-06 12:11:02] <Lurker69> i am sure it was used more times than 271 in 2 years
[2013-01-06 12:11:14] <lull> we cant get it rise
[2013-01-06 12:11:20] <lull> try and do one
[2013-01-06 12:11:22] <Daomos> unless it means that is how many times it has been used today

[2013-01-06 12:31:16] <bakpak2hvy> i tried to get in on it but i was too late
[2013-01-06 12:31:17] <Daffodilianv> I'm thinking that, given the themes of reciprocation and whatnot, and "the answer is all around you" inward/outward juxtaposition, the answer may be in the middle
[2013-01-06 12:31:54] <Daffodilianv> For instance, these are all primes and whatnot, the poem was 11/9/11 or 11/10/11 based on pronunciation, the twitter has 13 characters
[2013-01-06 12:32:09] <Daffodilianv> In that case the middle number is "7"
[2013-01-06 12:33:17] <lull> it would be 7.5?

[2013-01-06 12:33:18] <lull> im stupid
[2013-01-06 12:33:21] <bakpak2hvy> do you even division?
[2013-01-06 12:33:22] <Daffodilianv> 13 characters... you can have an even number of 6 characters on either side of 7
[2013-01-06 12:33:38] <lull> i was like lol theres 2 times 7 in 14
[2013-01-06 12:33:41] <lolxD> so the answer would be 123150 ?

[2013-01-06 12:41:09] <bakpak2hvy> 23:24 <@n_factor> i think the answer
[2013-01-06 12:41:09] <bakpak2hvy> 23:24 <@n_factor> is 3301
[2013-01-06 12:41:46] <lull> 3301 is linked to eveything
[2013-01-06 12:42:04] <lolxD> if 3301 lies everywhere, 3301 is the key
[2013-01-06 12:42:16] <bakpak2hvy> but a lot of things are everywher
[2013-01-06 12:42:21] <bakpak2hvy> we dont know its 3301

[2013-01-06 12:45:44] <lull> any1 think it means anything that there are 464 numbers in the boot and 464th prime happens to be 3301
[2013-01-06 12:46:01] <CheeseFingers> NikTitanik, you can backtrack all progress in the wiki ;)

[2013-01-06 12:47:01] <Daffodilianv> I also think it means things when 464 is poliambic and composed of evens
[2013-01-06 12:47:33] <Lurker69> I:14:136  means book 1  page 14 character number 136

[2013-01-06 13:03:08] <CheeseFingers> The Book of Law only advised that is would be wise to destroy is after reading, not that is actually will be destroyed
[2013-01-06 13:03:57] <CheeseFingers> also, it seems unlikely to leave traces that destroy clues, since it would dramatically decrease the chance of finding the people he wants

[2013-01-06 13:23:50] <Lurker69> 3301 cicada, this has been modified from your orriginal text in order to remove your uber sekret 0hd4y identifications signature.  If you think it belongs to any particular applicant it does not; and you DO know what I mean. u mad?
[2013-01-06 13:24:01] <Lurker69> that is reason for this first sentence
[2013-01-06 13:24:08] <Daffodilianv> Well not really "I will provide background information using publicly referanceable." - Not completely right but not bad, and definitely an upper-level education to the prose and substance
[2013-01-06 13:25:07] <Lurker69> anyway people that read this years long religious pastebin usualy react in one of two ways:
[2013-01-06 13:25:47] <Lurker69> 1. this is a group that is fighting for fredom on internet and is organized very cleverly
[2013-01-06 13:25:48] <Lurker69> or
[2013-01-06 13:25:55] <Lurker69> 2. this looks like a cult
[2013-01-06 13:26:12] <Lurker69> guess wich group of people cicada dont want
[2013-01-06 13:26:34] <Lurker69> selective reading
[2013-01-06 13:26:56] <Lurker69> you get what you bring in
[2013-01-06 13:27:00] <sr01> could be a cult
[2013-01-06 13:27:07] <gentoomen> Honestly, i think it looks like a cult. But i'm here because i hope it isn't.
[2013-01-06 13:28:02] <Lurker69> only last paragraph is mentioning religion and hoe writer find god and his son....   it looks like bullshit and it doesnt fit to the rest of the message
[2013-01-06 13:28:02] <sr01> so you would join, given the oppertunity?
[2013-01-06 13:28:25] <Lurker69> all the rest of the message is clearly antireligan
[2013-01-06 13:28:29] <gentoomen> Of course, but i would leave as soon as somebody asked me to sacrifice a goat :P
[2013-01-06 13:29:00] <lull> i would sacrifice a goat or a cow
[2013-01-06 13:29:08] <lull> would leave on dog
[2013-01-06 13:29:15] <Daffodilianv> I think that any selective, elitist society has cultist aspects. Consider the irony on the emphasis of teamwork, which brings us all here right now, and yet only individuals get selected
[2013-01-06 13:29:21] <sr01> would leave on human?
[2013-01-06 13:29:50] <sr01> inception
[2013-01-06 13:29:53] <Daffodilianv> The fact that earlier we were discussing the schizm and fragmentation that would occur once we actually get solid leads is just a testament to that
[2013-01-06 13:29:59] <sr01> you will be the one who is going to be sacrificed
[2013-01-06 13:30:04] <Lurker69> • believe in absolute freedom. Individual and the information.
[2013-01-06 13:30:04] <Lurker69> • they believe that there is no inherent meaning to anything. That all things are “empty and meaningless” 
[2013-01-06 13:30:04] <Lurker69> • They teach that absolute morality does not exist
[2013-01-06 13:30:04] <Lurker69> • They teach "There is no salvation in life; For there is nothing from which we must be saved.
[2013-01-06 13:30:05] <Lurker69> • They believe that within each person there is a "God." Not "God" in the sense of most religions, it is more like Übermensch in the writings of Nietzsche. They also see the Global Brain as another kind of "God"
[2013-01-06 13:30:05] <Lurker69> • Their mantra is "I am always enough." (Again, Übermensch)
[2013-01-06 13:30:21] <Lurker69> i see  word with no religion 
[2013-01-06 13:30:53] <sr01> is there anyone, like me, who already completely agreed on these points
[2013-01-06 13:31:11] <Daffodilianv> Consider that they tap into the internet
[2013-01-06 13:31:24] <Lurker69> • other philosophy they use is "what you resist persists" by Jung, and the Jesuit corollary "create what you fear most." For example, if you are afraid of resistance and rebellion, then send operators to create resistance and rebellion. This way, you can direct the energy of the people, embrace it, let it dwindle, and at the same time minimize the damage.
[2013-01-06 13:31:24] <Lurker69> ^  this sounds scarry
[2013-01-06 13:31:28] <Daffodilianv> It's not just "each man is a god" but "together we create god"
[2013-01-06 13:31:48] <Lurker69> sr01: you bet  we are
[2013-01-06 13:32:00] <Lurker69> most of us i believe
[2013-01-06 13:32:03] <sr01> good
[2013-01-06 13:32:16] <sr01> it doesnt sound scary, its strategy
[2013-01-06 13:32:58] <Lurker69> yes but cicada is and will be using it agauint us  during this quest, that is why it is scary
[2013-01-06 13:33:10] <Daffodilianv> Eh, I honestly am just intrigued by the organization of their body politic. Aside from them being a group of clever gents we really have no genuine notion of their motives or intentions
[2013-01-06 13:33:51] <Lurker69> Daffodilianv: just keep im mind that all that could als be just pile of BS
[2013-01-06 13:33:53] <CheeseFingers> power is often a very strong motive, i don't think they need much money
[2013-01-06 13:33:55] <Daffodilianv> Consider ,this is the second year. They recruited "some members'. They obviously had at least one before that (much much more for the posters, unless proxies). And the next? And the next?

[2013-01-06 13:36:36] <lull> my guess would be that theyre a pile of ppl doing these puzzle games and all they do is puzzle games, and u get selected to do the next puzzle

[2013-01-06 13:39:47] <scrounger> sorry, pseudonymous
[2013-01-06 13:39:54] <lit_envoy> perhaps the number is a code to a certain parable

[2013-01-06 13:40:17] <Daffodilianv> Yes, we also discussed the possibilty of Hebrew Numerism

[2013-01-06 13:40:57] <lit_envoy> As far as I understood it
[2013-01-06 13:41:06] <lit_envoy> it is about shedding something

[2013-01-06 13:49:46] <lit_envoy> why this bug?
[2013-01-06 13:50:25] <Daomos> a lot of ancient beliefs about them
[2013-01-06 13:51:30] <scrounger> "The cicada is an ancient polyvalent symbol: resounding themes are resurrection, immortality, spiritual realization and spiritual ecstasy. "
[2013-01-06 13:52:35] <Daffodilianv> In China, the phrase 'to shed off the golden cicada skin'(金蝉脱壳, pinyin: Jīn Chán tuōké) is the poetic name of the tactic of using deception to escape danger, specifically of using decoys
[2013-01-06 13:52:53] <Daffodilianv> Golden cicada skin/golden mean/phi
[2013-01-06 13:52:54] <Lurker69> Safe periods for the emergence of cicada species on prime number cycles", 
[2013-01-06 13:53:00] <scrounger> Hey, this is weir, and relates to the prime numbers again:  "Magicicada is the genus of the 13-year and 17-year periodical cicadas of eastern North America. " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodical_cicada
[2013-01-06 13:53:34] <Lurker69> Some species have much longer life cycles, such as the North American genus, Magicicada, which has a number of distinct "broods" that go through either a 17-year or, in some parts of the world, a 13-year life cycle. 
[2013-01-06 13:53:35] <Daomos> i know why they do that

[2013-01-06 13:54:19] <Daomos> there are cicadas that emerge every 13 or 17 years
[2013-01-06 13:54:28] <scrounger> something tells me the prime numbers are related.

[2013-01-06 13:55:20] <Daffodilianv> The Cicada is the symbol of the group, which happens to be facinated with primes and puzzles, we're not sure how it relates specifically to the parable/this puzzle, other than it being about cicadas, by Cicada

[2013-01-06 14:55:57] <Daffodilianv> And because it's five, there are quite a lot of primes in that list
[2013-01-06 14:56:05] <sr01> coders
[2013-01-06 14:56:06] <sr01> hm
[2013-01-06 14:56:11] <sr01> too bad i am not one
[2013-01-06 14:56:22] <Daffodilianv> Indeed
[2013-01-06 14:56:31] <lit_envoy> if 641 is a code for Iowa and the last set of digits in US numbers are of 4
[2013-01-06 14:56:33] <lit_envoy> perhaps
[2013-01-06 14:56:35] <lit_envoy> it's
[2013-01-06 14:56:42] <lit_envoy> 641 595 2771
[2013-01-06 14:56:51] <Daffodilianv> I'll try it
[2013-01-06 14:56:54] <Daffodilianv> one moment
[2013-01-06 14:57:43] <Daffodilianv> Could not be completed as dialed, dunno if its an actual number or not
[2013-01-06 14:58:49] <lull> hmm
[2013-01-06 14:59:16] <lull> i got this: your call is unable to proceed at this time
[2013-01-06 14:59:47] <sr01> at this time
[2013-01-06 15:00:23] <lull> dialed +6415952771
[2013-01-06 15:00:41] <Daffodilianv> 4 min/ 9 min/ 14 min/ 19 min/ 24 min/ 29 min
[2013-01-06 15:00:46] <Daffodilianv> I dialed it with a one
[2013-01-06 15:00:50] <sr01> interval of 5
[2013-01-06 15:00:58] <Daffodilianv> Yeah
[2013-01-06 15:01:25] <CheeseFingers> Dutch mobile phone numbers start with 06, however this number doesnt have the right length (needs to be 10 digits total)
[2013-01-06 15:01:35] <Daffodilianv> So depending on when you view the page, there's going to be a certain number of possible times posted, and some of those have to be prime (most)
[2013-01-06 15:02:08] <Daffodilianv> and usually in the pattern of prime/even/prime/even
[2013-01-06 15:02:31] <lull> guys
[2013-01-06 15:02:41] <lull> maby we get phone numver if we reverse?
[2013-01-06 15:03:07] <lull> 1772 595 146
[2013-01-06 15:03:24] <Daffodilianv> Eventually we're going to produce a phone number through sheer random chance and call up an 11 year old who just happens to coincidentally be an Illuminatus Cicada
[2013-01-06 15:03:25] <lull> 177 259 5146
[2013-01-06 15:04:05] <Daffodilianv> One moment please
[2013-01-06 15:05:31] <Daffodilianv> Negative
[2013-01-06 15:05:34] <lull> damn
[2013-01-06 15:06:36] <Daffodilianv> I am literally calling random numbers posted on an IRC at 605 am with over 23 tabs from the life cycle of Cicadas to Cryptology open.

[2013-01-06 15:07:53] <anonalaala> after looking at last years step by step solution... I'm gonna say that this is WAY over my head computer information wise.  Lurking in any case

[2013-01-06 15:09:02] <anonalaala> someone who is good with computers, who do we get into a file with an unknown extension...
[2013-01-06 15:09:10] <anonalaala> wait
[2013-01-06 15:09:27] <anonalaala> maybe the twitter is compiling a program that can open the 560 files
[2013-01-06 15:09:35] <anonalaala> and maybe there will be 560 tweets
[2013-01-06 15:09:46] <sr01> exactly
[2013-01-06 15:09:54] <sr01> a program doesnt have to be big
[2013-01-06 15:10:04] <NikTitanik> why 560?
[2013-01-06 15:10:04] <sr01> oui
[2013-01-06 15:10:16] <anonalaala> because the data files are all named 560
[2013-01-06 15:10:24] <NikTitanik> ah
[2013-01-06 15:10:41] <anonalaala> at this point I'm grasping at straws
[2013-01-06 15:10:57] <Daffodilianv> Alternatively, 464 for the 3301 prime relation
[2013-01-06 15:11:04] <anonalaala> last year things seemed somewhat obvious... similar to all the other internet scavanger hunts
[2013-01-06 15:11:16] <Daffodilianv> Eh
[2013-01-06 15:11:19] <Daffodilianv> It had it's moments
[2013-01-06 15:11:42] <Daffodilianv> It all starts with a simple image
[2013-01-06 15:13:00] <sr01> maybe this one is obvious too
[2013-01-06 15:13:18] <sr01> maybe we really just have to wait two days for the program to compile
[2013-01-06 15:13:19] <sr01> couldn't hurt
[2013-01-06 15:14:09] <anonalaala> I agree
[2013-01-06 15:14:30] <anonalaala> when the twitter stops sending tweets... I would imagine that will be an interesting moment
[2013-01-06 15:14:38] <anonalaala> are all the tweets being saved somewhere?
[2013-01-06 15:14:44] <Daffodilianv> Oh shit
[2013-01-06 15:14:49] <Daffodilianv> Yeah I'm on it
[2013-01-06 15:14:56] <Daffodilianv> Like, what if it reaches a number
[2013-01-06 15:15:04] <Daffodilianv> and then when it stops posting, it self-destructs
[2013-01-06 15:15:10] <anonalaala> exactly
[2013-01-06 15:15:15] <Daffodilianv> Like that demon book-burning thing
[2013-01-06 15:15:15] <sr01> certainly
[2013-01-06 15:16:09] <Daffodilianv> at 355 currently, I wonder what would happen if they got banned by twitter
[2013-01-06 15:16:24] <anonalaala> supporting my 560 theory
[2013-01-06 15:16:28] <anonalaala> 1000 tweets to get banned
[2013-01-06 15:17:34] <sr01> i am afraid that noone is logging the tweets

[2013-01-06 15:20:53] <Daffodilianv> I still think the posting times may be a solution, 1-59 at intervals of five
[2013-01-06 15:21:29] <anonalaala> you know the bizarre thing (could be a coincidence) is the twitter posted the first tweet
[2013-01-06 15:21:40] <Daffodilianv> hm>
[2013-01-06 15:21:40] <anonalaala> a few moments after someone in the original channel said
[2013-01-06 15:21:50] <anonalaala> Hey.,.. is that a twitter handle?
[2013-01-06 15:22:27] <Daffodilianv> hm, could be a coincidence, or red herring, or elaborate (and very quick) troll, or they're watching us and guiding us
[2013-01-06 15:22:29] <NikTitanik> no. someone had to program the bot prior. they couldnt have made the bot in the few moments
[2013-01-06 15:22:40] <Daffodilianv> Exactly
[2013-01-06 15:22:45] <anonalaala> I don't think its a troll
[2013-01-06 15:22:47] <anonalaala> I'm saying
[2013-01-06 15:22:49] <anonalaala> I think they see this
[2013-01-06 15:23:00] <Daffodilianv> Most definitely
[2013-01-06 15:23:11] <Daffodilianv> What would be the point of setting a mousetrap if you dont' see it in action?

[2013-01-06 15:23:44] <NikTitanik> TO MAKE RIDDLES
[2013-01-06 15:23:47] <lit_envoy> point of setting a mousetrap, at least for me
[2013-01-06 15:23:53] <lit_envoy> is to kill mice

[2013-01-06 15:25:41] <lit_envoy> Ithink that the "Parable" refers to the three lines below
[2013-01-06 15:25:44] <lit_envoy> because they are

[2013-01-06 15:29:25] <lit_envoy> number of a book?
[2013-01-06 15:29:28] <anonalaala> we checked
[2013-01-06 15:29:30] <anonalaala> its a dvd
[2013-01-06 15:29:31] <NikTitanik> we already tried that

[2013-01-06 16:22:57] <wop> goodmorning
[2013-01-06 16:23:02] <NikTitanik> hello
[2013-01-06 16:23:15] <wop> Any progress since lastnight?
[2013-01-06 16:23:51] <NikTitanik> kind of
[2013-01-06 16:24:16] <NikTitanik> we got the number 464 from 3301
[2013-01-06 16:24:25] <NikTitanik> 464 is the area code of illinois
[2013-01-06 16:24:35] <NikTitanik> the major city of illinois is cicero
[2013-01-06 16:25:00] <NikTitanik> but we are not sure if this is connected in any way
[2013-01-06 16:25:23] <wop> mmm ok
[2013-01-06 16:25:56] <scrounger> o_O
[2013-01-06 16:25:59] <scrounger> WTF?
[2013-01-06 16:26:32] <NikTitanik> and we also found some letters from cicero with the numbers from the mp3 (1,595,277,641 )
[2013-01-06 16:27:18] <lull> as we turned them into roman numbers they were marcus ciceros letters
[2013-01-06 16:31:56] <NikTitanik> did anyone else notice the song is quite quiet
[2013-01-06 16:32:14] <Daffodilianv> It's very minimalistic
[2013-01-06 16:32:23] <Daffodilianv> On another note, I'm back and updating the twitter
[2013-01-06 16:32:37] <Daffodilianv> Also I'll take a look at the wiki since you said it needs editing
[2013-01-06 16:33:59] <Daffodilianv> http://boards.4chan.org/lit/res/3326634       and here's the /lit/ thread, which is in need of a bump, although they don't take kindly to bumping on that board, so I'm not going to touch it until I think of something clever

[2013-01-06 16:42:27] <Daffodilianv> To any confirmed extent

[2013-01-06 16:43:59] <pr0> i wonder if we will b able to solve this years puzzle.  Seems harder this year than lasts
[2013-01-06 16:44:15] <anonalaala> I agree pr0

[2013-01-06 16:45:16] <anonalaala> here's last year's solution step by step: http://bernsteinbear.com/cicada
[2013-01-06 16:48:22] <Daffodilianv> They are very very patient
[2013-01-06 16:49:07] <Daffodilianv> Also, I just went through the "what we know so far" wiki and it seems good, although the more unnecessary conjecture may be trimmed down, and I will do that after I go over the rest of the wiki
[2013-01-06 16:49:30] <Daffodilianv> And I assume 7A35090F "the key is all around you" has already been discussed to death by Coders?
[2013-01-06 16:53:03] <pr0> At first I thought it could be pi since I found a Crowley quote talking about pi and keys
[2013-01-06 16:53:24] <Daffodilianv>  Anyway, it turns out we came accross a file here https://pastee.org/yqaf3  that has the word Parable in it, which has the number 761 in the middle of the number. I have reason to believe the other numbers in the phone number are important somehow
[2013-01-06 16:53:42] <Daffodilianv> On the wiki, what is that?
[2013-01-06 16:54:19] <Daffodilianv> I'm not going to remove it since well sage but It seems to be completly false or a wrong link
[2013-01-06 16:54:20] <anonalaala> it doesn't have 761 in it?
[2013-01-06 16:55:09] <pr0> is  1,595,277,641 a prime?
[2013-01-06 16:55:18] <Daffodilianv> Yes
[2013-01-06 16:55:26] <NikTitanik> everything is a prime..
[2013-01-06 16:55:29] <Daffodilianv> But it doesn't seem to have 761 in it
[2013-01-06 16:55:47] <pr0> what are the products of the prime
[2013-01-06 16:55:55] <Daffodilianv> But I'm just a saiyin, either someone fucked up or that's straight wrong, or someone did something I didn't

[2013-01-06 16:59:27] <pr0> thats a good idea we need to get all that we know there.  sooner or later someone will crack it
[2013-01-06 17:01:18] <pr0> i wonder why cicada is so obscess with primes
[2013-01-06 17:01:42] <CheeseFingers> primes have a prime role in encryption these days
[2013-01-06 17:01:54] <Daffodilianv> Because the internet is a prime specimen to hunt for ubermensch in their prime
[2013-01-06 17:02:00] <CheeseFingers> lol
[2013-01-06 17:02:13] <Daffodilianv> also, as an aside, I don't use twitter, but the search function doesn't do the content of the tweet, is that normal?
[2013-01-06 17:03:39] <pr0> no the search function is not intended for content
[2013-01-06 17:04:37] <pr0> cheesefingers i remember reading an article about that
[2013-01-06 17:05:42] <Daffodilianv> Yeah it's 'cause primes are still unsolved and factoring is a computatijonal bitch
[2013-01-06 17:06:03] <Daffodilianv> Also, that's probably the most I've copy-pasted since my 8th grade history term paper on the hundred year's war

[2013-01-06 17:07:37] <pr0> do these three primes show up anywhere else?
[2013-01-06 17:07:42] <CheeseFingers> well last year people had to wait some time as well
[2013-01-06 17:07:52] <Daffodilianv> It's not like disabling but I dunno how to fix it without fucking up the general layout
[2013-01-06 17:08:11] <CheeseFingers> maybe they do that to make sure everyone interested is at the same point in the puzzle
[2013-01-06 17:08:44] <CheeseFingers> at what date / time was the twitter feed expected to be complete? we had an expected amoutn of tweets right?
[2013-01-06 17:08:46] <yezae> yo dudes
[2013-01-06 17:09:00] <pr0> they might as well be watching to see how far we have come along
[2013-01-06 17:09:05] <Daffodilianv> That does make sense, or it's some sort of necessary preparation, like for instance it seemed to auto-activate once the ISO was d/l'd
[2013-01-06 17:09:20] <yezae> whats the revelation?
[2013-01-06 17:09:21] <Daffodilianv> one guess was 464 tweets
[2013-01-06 17:09:45] <pr0> itll def stop at a prime number
[2013-01-06 17:10:00] <Daffodilianv> careful now
[2013-01-06 17:10:00] <pr0> why 464?
[2013-01-06 17:10:21] <Daffodilianv> the idea was that it was the amount of primes between 1033 and 3301 or something to that extent
[2013-01-06 17:10:29] <Daffodilianv> It's not exactly solid
[2013-01-06 17:10:47] <Daffodilianv> But yeah, since Cic is probably watching they're going to stop at 400 now just to fuck with you
[2013-01-06 17:11:35] <pr0> cic is deliberate
[2013-01-06 17:11:51] <yezae> yeh but numbers are decieving
[2013-01-06 17:12:06] <yezae> look at something long enough and you will make connections that arent there

[2013-01-06 17:18:40] <Daffodilianv> I was going to add a poem section to the theories in progress but I can't seem to make a page for it, I could post it directly to the page but that would be rather obscene looking and cluster-ly
[2013-01-06 17:19:03] <Daffodilianv> If someone could like make a hyperlink for a poem page that would be great
[2013-01-06 17:21:29] <absolutezeroff> I think you should just look at the "What We Know" page instead.
[2013-01-06 17:21:58] <Daffodilianv> I did, and it seems alright, but I was going to move some of the conjecture about the poem to a different theories page
[2013-01-06 17:22:19] <absolutezeroff> Also, this clue said "you" not "we" like the last one.
[2013-01-06 17:22:22] <Daffodilianv> Since it's kinda shoe-horning a bunch of interpretation into an otherwise pretty factual statement

[2013-01-06 17:23:04] <alkapwn_> So I have a new theory. The poem derived from the song, could be referencing Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged". For those of you who haven't read it, it basically talks about what would happen if Atlas refused to hold the world (circumference?) on his shoulders. Here's how Rand described her novel: "not about the murder of man's body, but about the murder — and rebirth — of man's spirit" This again could reference the shedding our c

[2013-01-06 17:57:27] <sr01> is for the riddles
[2013-01-06 17:57:31] <sr01> this is more technical
[2013-01-06 17:58:01] <fasd> I still think the hex number is a color and the body of text is its placement
[2013-01-06 17:58:29] <sr01> i think that its a program that we have to compile after the twitter stops updating
[2013-01-06 17:58:42] <c4_> Cheers, I was mainly based in riddlers last night.
[2013-01-06 17:58:57] <sr01> oh right
[2013-01-06 17:59:16] <fasd> they wouldnt do that, they want us to pick up on the fact that it is infinite with 5 min intervals
[2013-01-06 18:00:07] <sr01> if that would be the case
[2013-01-06 18:00:32] <sr01> then its a message that encrypts the previous message
[2013-01-06 18:00:38] <sr01> uses the older message as seed
[2013-01-06 18:01:01] <fasd> you know whats infinite? a circle god dammit back at square one

[2013-01-06 18:33:22] <Daffodilianv> also I posted a thread on /lit/ which got us the dandy-man of cicero

[2013-01-06 18:33:34] <sr01> hax0rs channel
[2013-01-06 18:35:00] <Daffodilianv> Anyhow coders I gathered some data from the tweets I analyzed but I haven't the notion whether they're significant or not
[2013-01-06 18:35:40] <Anon654154> share
[2013-01-06 18:35:54] <Daffodilianv> Hardly a break-through but the 5-minute increment produces a certain number of patterns in the posting time of the tweets, which are tangently related to the poems
[2013-01-06 18:36:04] <Daffodilianv> aight one sec
[2013-01-06 18:36:06] <pr0> go on
[2013-01-06 18:36:35] <Daffodilianv>  pi is 314159 and phi is 1618 - prime/prime/even/prime/prime/prime and prime/even/prime/even, respectively
[2013-01-06 18:36:49] <Daffodilianv> since it's 5 minutes this will yield only a certain number of post times at any given start 1/2/3/4- up to 5 min, etc
[2013-01-06 18:37:06] * primius steps out for food
[2013-01-06 18:37:12] <Daffodilianv> In the twitter, and found them early on, both with only up to 4 characters, and posted only once  (pi and phi)
[2013-01-06 18:37:13] <sr01> same
[2013-01-06 18:37:27] <Daffodilianv> Looking at the times of the twitter I get even/prime/even/prime/even  or alternatively even/ prime/prime/even/prime/even/even/rpime/even/evenprime/prime
[2013-01-06 18:37:40] <Daffodilianv> When I do this with different time numbers, the pattern rarely changes (such as 11 being present, then 16), and tends to stabilize out towards higher numbers
[2013-01-06 18:38:02] <Daffodilianv> Also the poems are in the form of prime/prime/even/even for the first and prime/even/prime OR prime/prime/prime for the second
[2013-01-06 18:38:21] <Daffodilianv> But in genreral the post numbers when taken as a whole "11" or "1-1" seem to follow the same pattern

[2013-01-06 18:40:04] <Daffodilianv> Like that's all just data, I was analyzing it terms of primes, I'm not sure whether it's significant since I can't apply it to the coding processes relevant

[2013-01-06 18:40:23] <sr01> it might help
[2013-01-06 18:40:29] <lull> what?
[2013-01-06 18:40:29] <sr01> its certainly something
[2013-01-06 18:41:03] <Daffodilianv> Of course the pi/phi comes from the ideas of the poems

[2013-01-06 18:42:44] <lull> ty
[2013-01-06 18:44:12] <Daffodilianv> This is from just parsing through http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/1231507051321_Twitter, which I've been updating
[2013-01-06 18:44:22] <lull> fuck im so tired i read the upper line 5 ties
[2013-01-06 18:44:28] <Daffodilianv> As I said pi/phi appear early on and only once, and both up to 4 characters
[2013-01-06 18:45:00] <Daemos> http://www.allmytweets.net/?screen_name=1231507051321
[2013-01-06 18:45:38] <Daffodilianv> Well that certainly makes things easier
[2013-01-06 18:46:45] <Daffodilianv> Another thing to note is that at 3 characters pi appears 9 times and phi 8, although that's deeply derivative
[2013-01-06 18:48:17] <lit_envoy> so is anyone making those recruitment threads?
[2013-01-06 18:49:22] <Daffodilianv> Should make the channel first
[2013-01-06 18:51:22] <lull> lit_envoy you think rhere might be more in the poem?
[2013-01-06 18:51:47] <lit_envoy> Well if our thoughts are correct
[2013-01-06 18:51:55] <lit_envoy> the poem hints at circles
[2013-01-06 18:51:59] <lit_envoy> golden mean
[2013-01-06 18:52:05] <lit_envoy> perhaps
[2013-01-06 18:52:09] <lit_envoy> golden angle
[2013-01-06 18:52:19] <lit_envoy> and it's connection to the number
[2013-01-06 18:52:26] <lit_envoy> which could possibly be in radian
[2013-01-06 18:52:48] <Anon654154> I just got b& from 4chan. wtf
[2013-01-06 18:52:49] <lit_envoy> but that's as far as I am willling to go, my further theories might be "too wild"

[2013-01-06 18:55:28] <pr0> the letters in the prefix of the tweets stand for a number.  Is is the same or does it stay consistent?
[2013-01-06 18:56:41] <Daffodilianv> What prefix?
[2013-01-06 18:56:47] <Daffodilianv> the @XXXXX?
[2013-01-06 18:56:50] <brotherBox> Yes.
[2013-01-06 18:56:56] <pr0> yes
[2013-01-06 18:57:01] <brotherBox> It increases by 0x41 or 65 decimal
[2013-01-06 18:57:05] <Daffodilianv> I'm not sure but they're unique so far
[2013-01-06 18:57:48] <Daffodilianv> Also, I found 3301 and 1033 in the tweets once each
[2013-01-06 18:58:30] <pr0> so it does changes.  The letters in each tweet for the prefix i mean
[2013-01-06 18:59:13] <Daffodilianv> Yup
[2013-01-06 18:59:18] <pr0> you see two tweets ago two letters show up
[2013-01-06 18:59:20] <Daffodilianv> in an increasing fashion from 0
[2013-01-06 18:59:23] <alkapwn_> the "prefix" is just a counting tool...I've been copy and pasting the "body" of the tweets into my hex editor and I've had the correct "prefix" for the next tweet every single time
[2013-01-06 18:59:53] <pr0> but then wh change the number to letters?
[2013-01-06 18:59:54] <brotherBox> The tweets might be a file.
[2013-01-06 19:00:13] <CheeseFingers> yeah as i pointed out in #riddlers it's prolly a file or bin being outputted
[2013-01-06 19:00:18] <brotherBox> pr0, because hex takes two characters to display a byte.

[2013-01-06 19:00:26] <leakshmskill> hello?
[2013-01-06 19:00:27] <lit_envoy> Should I make a recruitment channel or is someone else doing it?
[2013-01-06 19:00:30] <brotherBox> Which makes me wondering...
[2013-01-06 19:00:39] <brotherBox> They could have used base64 too
[2013-01-06 19:00:55] <leakshmskill> are you guys talking about the twitter?
[2013-01-06 19:00:57] <lull> tried it
[2013-01-06 19:01:09] <Daemos> i think ive tried decoding it using base 64
[2013-01-06 19:01:09] <brotherBox> But they didn't. Which makes me think there is an encryption on the data they posted.
[2013-01-06 19:01:10] <Daffodilianv> Go for it
[2013-01-06 19:01:28] <brotherBox> Base64 only increases the data size by about a third iirc
[2013-01-06 19:01:30] <leakshmskill> the twitter isn't base64, or hex
[2013-01-06 19:01:37] <leakshmskill> we tried that last night
[2013-01-06 19:01:38] <Daemos> dec?
[2013-01-06 19:01:42] <brotherBox> It IS the hex charset leakshmskill
[2013-01-06 19:01:51] <Daffodilianv> Alright dudes
[2013-01-06 19:01:53] <brotherBox> The prefix IS in hex
[2013-01-06 19:02:03] <leakshmskill> but hex translation is meaningless
[2013-01-06 19:02:08] <Daffodilianv> Fun staying up all night with you all and dicking about this nonsense

[2013-01-06 19:02:21] <Daffodilianv> So I'll see you all tonight
[2013-01-06 19:02:45] <brotherBox> leakshmskill, it is a universal format. We might not use it directly, but it makes applying stuff (like crypto keys) easy.
[2013-01-06 19:02:46] <Daffodilianv> And hopefully you will invite me into your super-Cicada-decoders-chatroom instead of leaving me with the unculled filth

[2013-01-06 19:04:28] <Daemos> to test people?
[2013-01-06 19:04:30] <lit_envoy> Maybe for the first test, it is somewhat an easy task
[2013-01-06 19:04:50] <CheeseFingers> they can google an online converter, doesn seem too hard..?
[2013-01-06 19:05:00] <Daemos> 74 68 69 73 20 69 73 20 74 65 73 74
[2013-01-06 19:05:01] <brotherBox> Doesn't matter that much.
[2013-01-06 19:05:12] <brotherBox> I think we want people who recognize what it is
[2013-01-06 19:05:22] <Daemos> ah
[2013-01-06 19:05:23] <lit_envoy> well
[2013-01-06 19:05:26] <lit_envoy> if they google that
[2013-01-06 19:05:27] <brotherBox> Or we do some kind of xor stuff
[2013-01-06 19:05:30] <lit_envoy> they'll probably
[2013-01-06 19:05:35] <lit_envoy> just
[2013-01-06 19:05:39] <lit_envoy> see that it's hex

[2013-01-06 19:08:24] <fasd> the message in the twitter could be a packet from a ping
[2013-01-06 19:08:55] <sr01> you think that the twitter bot pings their server every 5 mins?
[2013-01-06 19:09:32] <brotherBox> Do you even icmp?
[2013-01-06 19:10:24] <sr01> i dont
[2013-01-06 19:10:58] <sr01> hex is too long i think
[2013-01-06 19:11:27] <brotherBox> We could make two test

[2013-01-06 19:19:16] <lulzorz> -.-
[2013-01-06 19:19:41] <brotherBox> Or N + d for the private key
[2013-01-06 19:19:43] <lulzorz> give people two hex strings to xor
[2013-01-06 19:20:33] <brotherBox> Breaking an RSA key works like this: you factorize n. The rest is simple math.
[2013-01-06 19:22:13] <CheeseFingers> it's all on wikipedia anyways, it's not as if this is top secret military anymore

[2013-01-06 19:24:12] <lit_envoy> I agree with this

[2013-01-06 19:29:58] <fasd> we could make the test as simple as hiding a text file in a jpg and the text file would only contain this url
[2013-01-06 19:30:30] <Daemos> ^that
[2013-01-06 19:30:45] <lulzorz> heh...one could append the URL to the original image without breaking the outguess, I think
[2013-01-06 19:31:08] <Lurker69> not sure if we are here to make pzzzles...  we are here to solve them, besides that breaking RSA is quite hard puzle fo verybody that doesnt know math  and coding very well

[2013-01-06 19:32:58] <c4_> They won't know they're doing it to join ours, they'll think that's the one, unless ew invite them.
[2013-01-06 19:34:21] <Lurker69> like out of 100 random people on reddit maybe 5  are capable to solve RSA if they spend quite few hours on it, even if you make factorization dead simple... but it is true that people who will be able to solve it would all be top notch...
[2013-01-06 19:35:35] <Lurker69> i would put standars much lower, like only reading what happened last year and understanding most of it wouzld be enough to qualify, you need to spend few hours just to go thhrouh that anyway

[2013-01-06 19:39:16] <lit_envoy> okay, I'll fix up the wiki. Retype some stuff so it's easier to read. Can I edit it on the go or do I need permissions/admin rights?

[2013-01-06 19:39:59] <brotherBox> Lurker69, I was thinking about a very small RSA puzzle
[2013-01-06 19:40:16] <brotherBox> Something like "N = 32435, e = 4, message = 398473489 34t5943876345 3459873453 34598437"
[2013-01-06 19:40:27] <brotherBox> Or whatever, these values are probably crap
[2013-01-06 19:40:30] <brotherBox> Yep they are

[2013-01-06 19:51:52] <Lesmo> 3301b then?

[2013-01-06 19:55:18] <anonalaala> I still think we need to actually identify the song
[2013-01-06 19:55:31] <anonalaala> last year there were pictures and references to pieces of art and literature
[2013-01-06 19:55:36] <anonalaala> I don't think they "made" the song
[2013-01-06 19:55:43] <anonalaala> so whatever it really is... is extremely important

[2013-01-06 19:57:57] <c4_> Anyone tried Shazam on the song?
[2013-01-06 19:58:08] <Lesmo> I was about to do that...
[2013-01-06 19:58:14] <c4_> Good minds.
[2013-01-06 19:58:26] <c4_> Post results, obviously.
[2013-01-06 19:59:55] <Lurker69> fasd: i like it you now need to make some text that will attract people and motivate them to start looking for a solution, then you need few people that will keep the  /b/ thread alive... inb4 you have to creat you own little cicada organization, you can start writing philosophical pastebins now... :-)
[2013-01-06 20:00:03] <Daemos> has anyone tried reversing the song?
[2013-01-06 20:00:07] <Anon404> Just thought about this: musical notes range from a-g, almost a-f like hex, maybe we should write the partition
[2013-01-06 20:00:21] <Lurker69> daemopos it is rhe same if you reverse it
[2013-01-06 20:00:40] <lit_envoy> Should we have a "logo" of a Cicada on the wiki?
[2013-01-06 20:00:44] <c4_> Anything lesmo?
[2013-01-06 20:00:58] <Lurker69> daemos and if you you play reversed and normal recording at same time it is silence... i think that is how it works

[2013-01-06 20:14:52] <Daemos> ok
[2013-01-06 20:14:58] <anonalaala> every word choice, historically (aka last year), has been extremely important
[2013-01-06 20:15:11] <anonalaala> we're thinking VERY abstract and artistic about these "poems"
[2013-01-06 20:15:28] <anonalaala> but remember the original outguess clue?
[2013-01-06 20:15:35] <anonalaala> the poem was more or less irrelevant
[2013-01-06 20:15:49] <Daemos> i wasnt doing this last year
[2013-01-06 20:16:00] <anonalaala> the point is, these words they're using
[2013-01-06 20:16:16] <anonalaala> mean specific things related to the decryption or tools needed to decrypt
[2013-01-06 20:16:34] <fasd> what has multiple circumferences?
[2013-01-06 20:16:35] <lit_envoy> I pointed this out already
[2013-01-06 20:16:35] <anonalaala> so I think we need to stop analyzing the "meaning" and start looking into what these words can mean

[2013-01-06 20:25:21] <NikTitanik> as wifi passwords, etc...
[2013-01-06 20:25:29] <Lesmo> Nah seriously lull_ where?
[2013-01-06 20:25:44] <Daemos> utorrent?
[2013-01-06 20:26:10] <lull_> it might be crypted magnet or then im just hallucinating
[2013-01-06 20:27:09] <c4_> Someone mentioned the word choice of the poem before, and something I think is interesting is "find the divinity within". Would the sentence not make more sense, saying, find divinity within...
[2013-01-06 20:27:10] <sr01> now that would be nice
[2013-01-06 20:27:36] <sr01> it does, c4
[2013-01-06 20:27:42] <Cheese|busy> divinity within might as well refer to the data files we have to unpack..
[2013-01-06 20:28:11] <c4_> I was saying it says the divinity. The word 'the' there, doesn't fit, nor is needed
[2013-01-06 20:28:17] <Cheese|busy> ah

[2013-01-06 20:30:45] <bakpak2hvy> i know tor and i2p and freenet
[2013-01-06 20:31:04] <anonalaala> onion also gives a nod to "circumferences"
[2013-01-06 20:31:08] <fasd> could it be referring to a ssh tunnel?

[2013-01-06 20:32:21] <fasd> what protocol has to do with a surface?

[2013-01-06 20:32:54] <anonalaala> yes yes ssh tunneling or something like this... this is much more Cicada feel

[2013-01-06 20:33:18] <bakpak2hvy> do cicadas tunnel in the ground to protect themselves or something?

[2013-01-06 20:36:57] <sr01> well done
[2013-01-06 20:37:10] <bakpak2hvy> sr01: if you're right, and we're also right about the # of tweets, we better figure something out soon

[2013-01-06 20:38:06] <Lesmo> But I've tried that on tweets already
[2013-01-06 20:38:09] <Lesmo> ... and says nothing

[2013-01-06 20:38:32] <sr01> i tried it too
[2013-01-06 20:38:34] <fasd> there is no way they would let it just be a simple decode
[2013-01-06 20:38:39] <anonalaala> ^
[2013-01-06 20:38:40] <Lesmo> And I cannot seem to find any magic bytes there, so I guess we can discard that thing is a file in pieces.
[2013-01-06 20:38:50] <anonalaala> ?
[2013-01-06 20:38:55] <sr01> we will know if we have to link em
[2013-01-06 20:39:02] <sr01> thats when they stop updating

[2013-01-06 20:43:05] <Lesmo> Yes.
[2013-01-06 20:43:15] <leakhmskill> at 464, it runs out of combinations

[2013-01-06 20:43:33] <lull_> anonalaala it came from tht, there are 464 prime numbes in the boot and 3301 happens to be the 464th prime number aaand there was another stuff tht i cant recall

[2013-01-06 20:45:09] <leakhmskill> a while back
[2013-01-06 20:45:28] <sr01> last year

[2013-01-06 20:46:49] <fasd> so we are looking for a king?
[2013-01-06 20:47:47] <fasd> like 3301 it the king prime number

[2013-01-06 20:48:22] <leakhmskill> no idea

[2013-01-06 20:48:25] <Daemos> who was king of england in 1033?
[2013-01-06 20:48:38] <lit_envoy> no one
[2013-01-06 20:48:47] <lit_envoy> First english king is William the Conqueror
[2013-01-06 20:48:50] <lit_envoy> in 1066
[2013-01-06 20:48:52] <Daemos> oh yeah
[2013-01-06 20:49:04] <Daemos> french king?
[2013-01-06 20:49:10] <leakhmskill> February 2 – Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor, becomes King of Burgundy.

[2013-01-06 20:59:53] <fasd> the internet is all around us, by extension twitter is, so could the tweets be the key
[2013-01-06 21:00:01] <leakhmskill> the twitter looks like hex (base 16) or base 64
[2013-01-06 21:00:09] <leakhmskill> maybe it is in base 464

[2013-01-06 21:00:50] <lit_envoy> Maybe we should start doing something

[2013-01-06 21:09:40] <leakhmskill> maybe we need to find a specific tweet
[2013-01-06 21:09:44] <Daemos> can someone find a torrent of it maybe
[2013-01-06 21:09:52] <leakhmskill> one with a specific opening
[2013-01-06 21:09:53] <c4_> I couldn't find one
[2013-01-06 21:10:11] <c4_> But that guide, as it is readily available, and on math, I think that could contain how o crack the code
[2013-01-06 21:11:26] <Daemos> try it
[2013-01-06 21:12:58] <c4_> From central tendencies to frequency and  distribution to sample selection methods, introduce students to more advanced concepts of statistics  and data analysis. Any of them notions helpful/usable?

[2013-01-06 21:14:35] <Lesmo> Sounds like it.
[2013-01-06 21:14:52] <Cooper_> So someone mentioned in the wiki how 761 was not an area code, but 232, another number that was mentioned before, is. so a possible number to call is 232-761-????
[2013-01-06 21:15:07] <Cooper_> Sorry if I interrupted something here. Had to join to mention this.
[2013-01-06 21:15:08] <leakhmskill> 232-761-3301?
[2013-01-06 21:15:18] <Cooper_> tried 232-761-3301 already
[2013-01-06 21:15:20] <Cooper_> busy signal.
[2013-01-06 21:15:24] <leakhmskill> 232-761-1033?
[2013-01-06 21:15:31] <Cooper_> But, you know how in the boot iso
[2013-01-06 21:15:37] <Cooper_> leak beat me to it.
[2013-01-06 21:15:37] <fasd> 247 is also a number to look into
[2013-01-06 21:16:14] <leakhmskill> anyone call 232-761-1033 yet?
[2013-01-06 21:16:20] <Cooper_> 1033 gave the busy signal as well.
[2013-01-06 21:16:28] <leakhmskill> although, I have no idea where we got 761 abd 232

[2013-01-06 21:17:01] <Cooper_> lets try 247

[2013-01-06 21:17:22] <leakhmskill> I think palindromes have a lot to do with this

[2013-01-06 21:19:54] <leakhmskill> no, phone numbers are 10 digits
[2013-01-06 21:20:05] <leakhmskill> 1-000-000-0000
[2013-01-06 21:20:09] <Cooper_> 11 if you count the country code
[2013-01-06 21:20:16] <fasd> lets look at this again - A book whose study is forbidden Once dictated to a beast; To be read once and then destroyed Or you shall have no peace.
[2013-01-06 21:20:30] <Cooper_> beast?
[2013-01-06 21:20:35] <Cooper_> The number of the beast maybe?

[2013-01-06 21:20:43] <NikTitanik> its the book of law, fasd
[2013-01-06 21:20:49] <lull_> also very mathematical number
[2013-01-06 21:20:58] <fasd> i know but there has to be more
[2013-01-06 21:20:59] <Cooper_> but I'm pretty sure we were past useing that quote.
[2013-01-06 21:21:12] <leakhmskill> you never know
[2013-01-06 21:21:27] <Cooper_> I hope I don't get charged for caling numbers that don't exist. -_-

[2013-01-06 21:21:37] <lit_envoy> this one
[2013-01-06 21:21:42] <Lurker69> you guys guessing phone numbers?
[2013-01-06 21:21:43] <fasd> the to be read once and then destroyed still screams TOR and the have no peace part keeps nagging at me
[2013-01-06 21:21:49] <lit_envoy> is what we should be readying
[2013-01-06 21:22:03] <Lesmo> We're past the 426 mark we thought about the tweets.
[2013-01-06 21:22:11] <Lurker69> i think that that wont be the the way, but i cant really tlle
[2013-01-06 21:22:11] <leakhmskill> it was 464
[2013-01-06 21:22:16] <leakhmskill> not 426
[2013-01-06 21:22:18] <NikTitanik> anyone has the link to the graph showing the last years riddle?

[2013-01-06 21:23:16] <Lurker69> i am sure that cicada doesnt waant us to spam random people on  phones asking them if they are cicada...  dont forget that last year phone number was presented in specific way so everybody knew instantly that it was phone number
[2013-01-06 21:23:34] <fasd> it says "you shall have no peace" the only thing I can relate this to is what we are going through right now

[2013-01-06 21:25:00] <leakhmskill> what part of this are we trying to solve?
[2013-01-06 21:25:35] <Lurker69> Cooper_: you want logs?
[2013-01-06 21:25:43] <Lesmo> http://pastebin.com/jpH95t4F < All tweets so far (until 2 min ago) in a fancy and more handy way
[2013-01-06 21:26:05] <Cooper_> Don't really need logs, just trying to undo the possible damage I cause by popping in with a random idea.
[2013-01-06 21:26:22] <bthemightyb> so did the tweets every stop?
[2013-01-06 21:26:27] <Lurker69> also if anyone here  has a irc bot and is skilled with it fell fre  tto bring it in channels and begin logging, idealy we would stream irc logs in wiki

[2013-01-06 21:30:01] <Cooper_> Yes.
[2013-01-06 21:30:03] <leakhmskill> maybe we need to find tweets with prime number headings

[2013-01-06 21:31:01] <Cooper_> I think before we are able to decode the tweets, we need to find another clue.
[2013-01-06 21:31:02] <leakhmskill> and the other stuff is a bunch of hints to find the right tweet

[2013-01-06 21:31:41] <lit_envoy> could these be the numbers of the tweets?
[2013-01-06 21:31:47] <Cooper_> Or is it possible, that the tweets are not messaged, but keys to decrypt something else?
[2013-01-06 21:31:59] <lit_envoy> but if that is the key
[2013-01-06 21:32:02] <lit_envoy> where is the lock?
[2013-01-06 21:32:07] <Cooper_> Remember, we still have that 113 MB myestery file that came with the prime iso.

[2013-01-06 21:49:03] <Cooper_> Instead of the busy tone, I got "your call can not be completed as dialed" but in a different voice form the one my carrier uses.
[2013-01-06 21:49:14] <Cooper_> And there was other shit in the background

[2013-01-06 21:53:24] <Lurker69> if there will be phone it will  be clearly presented as phone number (like last year) i am sure cicada dont want us to call 100 random numbers asking if they are cicada

[2013-01-06 21:54:59] <leakhmskill> what was the final result, the "prize" of winning last year?
[2013-01-06 21:54:59] <fasd> some sort of surface protocol
[2013-01-06 21:55:00] <Cooper_> Yeah

[2013-01-06 21:58:23] <NikTitanik> ok
[2013-01-06 21:58:35] <NikTitanik> just wanted to check if its the same as last year

[2013-01-06 21:59:16] <NikTitanik> yeah i know

[2013-01-06 22:02:05] <Cooper_> Lurker has a point
[2013-01-06 22:02:14] <Cooper_> I think we might be focusing too much on what happened this year.
[2013-01-06 22:02:20] <Cooper_> This shit is supposed to be challenging.
[2013-01-06 22:02:41] <fasd> last year they did not have a last year to look at
[2013-01-06 22:02:45] <Cooper_> It wouldn't be a challenge if we could use the same tactics that were documented from last year.
[2013-01-06 22:03:14] <Lurker69> this wa last years clue on the phone: "Very good. You have done well. There are three prime numbers associated with the original final.jpg image. 3301 is one of them.

[2013-01-06 22:39:41] <Lesmo> Yeah. But oddly there is no header telling it's such, so probably it needs fixing.

[2013-01-06 22:41:11] <NikTitanik> can you dump all the tweets into a single file? without the first 7 letters and the :
[2013-01-06 22:41:16] <hofstadter> is that a decode of just one tweet?
[2013-01-06 22:41:25] <NikTitanik> its a translate from hex to ascii
[2013-01-06 22:41:29] <NikTitanik> no real ricket science
[2013-01-06 22:41:29] <sr01> probably not
[2013-01-06 22:41:35] <lull> hmm that would make sense! can you try to get the pieces together? im with phone atm
[2013-01-06 22:41:46] <sr01> its corrupt atm probably
[2013-01-06 22:41:52] <sr01> since we dont have all the tweets
[2013-01-06 22:42:04] <sr01> we will know when it stops dumping

[2013-01-06 22:56:52] <Lesmo> Pretty much.
[2013-01-06 22:57:02] <c4_> How are we using the tweets to view it?

[2013-01-06 22:57:24] <NikTitanik> the twitter is slowly dumping the jpg
[2013-01-06 22:57:27] <Lesmo> JPG we're talking about is being dumped by the Twitter in Hex format.
[2013-01-06 22:57:36] <NikTitanik> patience is a virtue, as they said last year
[2013-01-06 22:57:41] <scrounger> GODDAMN IT, I KNOW THIS.
[2013-01-06 22:57:44] <Lesmo> Exactly.

[2013-01-06 22:58:25] <zeke__> cooper, how did you get a jpg?  i cat'ed everything into a jpg file and no dice
[2013-01-06 22:58:30] <Lesmo> I've been trying, but looks like there's a header missing.
[2013-01-06 22:58:40] <Lesmo> Exactly.
[2013-01-06 22:58:48] <leakhmskill> zeke__ we need the whole image
[2013-01-06 22:58:55] <leakhmskill> it is only spitting out parts of it
[2013-01-06 22:59:05] <leakhmskill> then we string it all together, get the whole image
[2013-01-06 22:59:13] <sr01> sometimes programs can repair it, but not when there's a lot of info missing
[2013-01-06 22:59:21] <scrounger> what code are you using to get this?

[2013-01-06 22:59:47] <sr01> to get what?
[2013-01-06 22:59:49] <zeke__> gotcha, ty.  looks like tweets are still rolling anyway
[2013-01-06 23:00:11] <Lurker69> i dont know if we can see the image before we get full file
[2013-01-06 23:00:25] <sr01> depends on how much is missing
[2013-01-06 23:00:44] <Cooper_> Oh great. Me squeal of delight made it into the paste.
[2013-01-06 23:00:44] <Lurker69> but probbably there are some jpg debuggers online, to recover  damaged pictures, i have never used any though

[2013-01-06 23:02:57] <scrounger> Wait... you're saying that the big secret all this time was that cicada is just tweeting a hexdump of an image?
[2013-01-06 23:03:13] <leakhmskill> pretty much
[2013-01-06 23:03:18] <sr01> we cant be sure until we open it
[2013-01-06 23:03:26] <sr01> maybe the mp3 is for the next one
[2013-01-06 23:03:45] <scrounger> I mean...  xxd will put hexdumps back together into their binary format. there's no magic here.
[2013-01-06 23:03:53] <Lurker69> scrounger: looks like it and itr is one of those faceplam moments... resson why we love puzzles
[2013-01-06 23:04:06] <hofstadter> there's still the poem
[2013-01-06 23:04:14] <scrounger> ok...
[2013-01-06 23:04:36] <c4_> Maybe the poem will make sense once we see the image
[2013-01-06 23:04:41] <scrounger> wait, somebody run xxd on the hexdumps and the "file" on the output real quick?
[2013-01-06 23:04:50] <leakhmskill> well
[2013-01-06 23:04:52] <leakhmskill> looking at last year

[2013-01-06 23:09:31] <Cheese|busy> besides that, some people calling random phone nrs :p
[2013-01-06 23:09:34] <fasd> has any one just lined up the colors yet?
[2013-01-06 23:09:41] <rr645> I'm sorry if I'm barging in and rehashing questions that have already been asked, but did anyone here participate in the previous game?
[2013-01-06 23:10:03] <fasd> if its a rainbow the fuck
[2013-01-06 23:10:10] <rb9269> Lined up the colours?
[2013-01-06 23:10:11] <fasd> then*
[2013-01-06 23:10:51] <fasd> like just had straight bands going from left to right of each color in order of the tweets
[2013-01-06 23:11:25] <Lurker69> fasd: we probabyl know that twets are jpg
[2013-01-06 23:11:36] <Lurker69> we j just figured it out

[2013-01-06 23:11:50] <NikTitanik> xxd doesnt do much...
[2013-01-06 23:11:59] <rb9269> ah the hex values
[2013-01-06 23:12:38] <Cooper_> God dammit this one turned out to be one of the more simple ones, but because we were all overthinking it, we got lost.
[2013-01-06 23:12:53] <leakhmskill> how many tweets?
[2013-01-06 23:13:01] <leakhmskill> 450
[2013-01-06 23:13:04] <Cooper_> estimated to end at 464
[2013-01-06 23:13:08] <NikTitanik> its going to be a lot more if its a jpg
[2013-01-06 23:13:26] <Cooper_> It might be small...
[2013-01-06 23:13:45] <Lesmo> It could have degraded quality
[2013-01-06 23:13:55] <Lesmo> ... or really small in resolution
[2013-01-06 23:13:59] <Cooper_> It is currently at around 43 kb
[2013-01-06 23:14:09] <Cooper_> So I would assume a very low resolution.
[2013-01-06 23:14:13] <fasd> has some one made part of the jpg yet or do we need it all?
[2013-01-06 23:14:20] <leakhmskill> might be something really tiny
[2013-01-06 23:14:22] <Cooper_> Possibly just an image with text.
[2013-01-06 23:14:27] <Cooper_> most likely will have a URL.
[2013-01-06 23:14:48] <Lurker69> about simplicity dont forget where we are http://prntscr.com/ocw8h  first step pretty much 
[2013-01-06 23:14:57] <Lurker69> well 2nd first was book of law
[2013-01-06 23:15:24] <Lurker69> and usually all puzzles looks fairly simple when you know the solution
[2013-01-06 23:15:32] <Lesmo> I know there's a way to see the image even if corrupted.
[2013-01-06 23:16:30] <lull> lesmo it might have everything important with the last lines?
[2013-01-06 23:16:41] <Cooper_> I think it is the line breaks that are fucking it up.
[2013-01-06 23:16:56] <NikTitanik> lesmo posted a file without the line breaks
[2013-01-06 23:16:59] <Lesmo> Line breaks are out, cooper...

[2013-01-06 23:17:01] <fasd> I might sound dumb here but how are we going to make a jpg out of it?
[2013-01-06 23:17:12] <Cooper_> Where? I didn't see sorry.
[2013-01-06 23:17:16] <NikTitanik> it should go with xxd if im correct
[2013-01-06 23:17:16] <Lesmo> ... as some one said, xxd
[2013-01-06 23:17:28] <NikTitanik> but i cant seem to do a reverse dump
[2013-01-06 23:17:38] <NikTitanik> it always produces an empty file
[2013-01-06 23:17:43] <Cooper_> Nevermind.
[2013-01-06 23:17:45] <Cooper_> Found it.
[2013-01-06 23:17:49] <Lurker69> Lesmo: probably but i havent got experience with it, forencisc sure have some tools for that also ifyou search interent for "recover corrupted jpg" maybe you can fing somezthinkg
[2013-01-06 23:18:51] <Lurker69> http://forums.techguy.org/digital-photography-imaging/789597-repair-corrupt-jpgs-dummies.html  first google
[2013-01-06 23:19:57] <NikTitanik> got the image
[2013-01-06 23:20:03] <NikTitanik> but it isnt really anything
[2013-01-06 23:20:08] <NikTitanik> still too small
[2013-01-06 23:20:14] <NikTitanik> we need to feed it more data
[2013-01-06 23:20:21] <Lesmo> ... post it?
[2013-01-06 23:20:42] <lull> hmmm the data folder might belong to it????
[2013-01-06 23:20:48] <NikTitanik> it doesnt show anything, it comes as corrupt, and outguess says Not a JPEG file: starts with 0xb6 0x9c
[2013-01-06 23:20:48] <sr01> how
[2013-01-06 23:21:03] <rb9269> Thats what i was just trying to do with the data we have at the moment, run a recovary program without all the data
[2013-01-06 23:21:12] <NikTitanik> we will ahve to wait untill twitter dumps it all
[2013-01-06 23:21:25] <Lurker69> http://www.impulseadventure.com/photo/fix-corrupt-jpeg-photo.html  this might work
[2013-01-06 23:21:26] <leakhmskill> 14 more tweets
[2013-01-06 23:21:32] <leakhmskill> 70 more minutes
[2013-01-06 23:21:39] <rb9269> but the last few tweets shouldnt make that much of a difference to the file
[2013-01-06 23:21:40] <Lurker69> patience is a virtue
[2013-01-06 23:21:52] <leakhmskill> is there anything else we can work on?

[2013-01-06 23:26:02] <NikTitanik> so now we have to wait untill twitter dumps it all, dmp it into a file without line breaks, reverse the hexdump into a image with xxd

[2013-01-06 23:35:31] <Cooper_> Me too, but I know my way around the windows command line and the linux command line works under similar principles.

[2013-01-06 23:36:17] <scrounger> pretty sure it's -r
[2013-01-06 23:36:20] <scrounger> but check the man page
[2013-01-06 23:36:35] <scrounger> you'll have to specify some things
[2013-01-06 23:36:35] <Cooper_> it can't be -r 'd because it is already in ascii.
[2013-01-06 23:36:42] <Cooper_> tried already.
[2013-01-06 23:36:49] <scrounger> no, it's in hex
[2013-01-06 23:36:54] <Lesmo> Exactly...
[2013-01-06 23:37:05] <scrounger> hex != ascii
[2013-01-06 23:37:06] <Cooper_> The version in dump.jpg is in ascii
[2013-01-06 23:37:10] <scrounger> although hex can be represented in ascii
[2013-01-06 23:37:13] <scrounger> oh, ok.
[2013-01-06 23:37:16] <scrounger> my bad.
[2013-01-06 23:37:32] <Cooper_> and putting it into hex gives us the text from the tweets.
[2013-01-06 23:37:45] <Cooper_> Wait.
[2013-01-06 23:37:54] <Cooper_> What about the headers from the tweets?
[2013-01-06 23:38:00] <Cooper_> Did we include those?
[2013-01-06 23:38:04] <Lesmo> Oh right.. well, not.
[2013-01-06 23:38:25] <Cooper_> Because if we did, they may be causing the errors.
[2013-01-06 23:38:51] <Lesmo> No, they're not in the last pastebins I made.
[2013-01-06 23:38:52] <iIIustrious> it seems sketchy that it would have a header exactly 65 off every 130 characters, if it was supposed to be in the text

[2013-01-06 23:39:13] <Cooper_> Hmm.
[2013-01-06 23:39:17] <Cooper_> Let me try again.
[2013-01-06 23:39:37] <Cheese|busy> the index is the index of the hex in pairs of 2
[2013-01-06 23:39:46] <Cheese|busy> 130/2 = 65
[2013-01-06 23:40:14] <Lesmo> Yeah, well... that doesn't match the count on the tweet index though
[2013-01-06 23:40:50] <Lesmo> ... oh wait, it does.
[2013-01-06 23:40:52] <Cheese|busy> 0x41 = 65 ?
[2013-01-06 23:41:04] <Lesmo> Yeah, exactly.

[2013-01-06 23:53:13] <bakpak2hvy> then we're like out of ideas
[2013-01-06 23:53:14] <immortalghost> until the last tweet

[2013-01-06 23:53:26] <iIIustrious> or, we have the right idea but have to wait longer

[2013-01-06 23:53:39] <Cooper_> I edited the wiki with the findings of the jpg header.

[2013-01-06 23:53:50] <Lurker69> leakhmskill: dont worry we only solved 2 puzzles so far
[2013-01-06 23:53:56] <Lurker69> 1 and a half
[2013-01-06 23:54:00] <CheeseFingers> last year a lot people were fooled towards a decoy by a subgroup
[2013-01-06 23:54:10] <Cooper_> Not sure if I worded it in an easy to understand way though so take a look at it.
[2013-01-06 23:54:16] <Cooper_> And the link is in the topic.
[2013-01-06 23:54:27] <hofstadter> ooooh, then when the poem said shed the circumferences and find the divinity within they could have meant they would get rid of the outliers and find the core group they want to work with
[2013-01-06 23:54:28] <Lurker69> CheeseFingers: we are working hard that that wouldnt happen this year
[2013-01-06 23:54:28] <leakhmskill> I guess, I just hope I'm able to do something interesting and stay along for the ride
[2013-01-06 23:54:30] <Cooper_> Look for the "what we know" page.

[2013-01-06 23:57:23] <immortalghost> were tweet numbers

[2013-01-06 23:58:03] <leakhmskill> super tiny jpg
[2013-01-06 23:58:08] <immortalghost> might be text

[2013-01-06 23:58:13] <Cooper_> The tweets are around 35 bytes each
[2013-01-06 23:58:15] <leakhmskill> maybe
[2013-01-06 23:58:19] <scrounger> so then the key being all around us means that there's no key?
[2013-01-06 23:58:24] <iIIustrious> I wonder if it's a phone number that they may give us the last digit to later

[2013-01-06 23:58:42] <Lurker69> 1595 277641 = 1031 x 1229 x 1259   this might be important in futere regarding parable

[2013-01-07 00:13:19] <leakhmskill> or both together
[2013-01-07 00:13:30] <bakpak2hvy> i can grab the 174th

[2013-01-07 00:23:44] <bakpak2hvy> till we find out if were right
[2013-01-07 00:23:51] <Cooper_> lesmo, how did you remove the headers?
[2013-01-07 00:23:53] <miklja> I am NikTitanik btw
[2013-01-07 00:24:00] <miklja> Just on my phome
[2013-01-07 00:24:02] <Cooper_> Did you go through one by one?
[2013-01-07 00:24:35] <leakhmskill> all i got from the download was invalid image

[2013-01-07 00:24:42] <Lesmo> What headers are you talking about cooper?
[2013-01-07 00:24:54] <leakhmskill> the first 7 numbers
[2013-01-07 00:24:59] <leakhmskill> at the start of each tweet
[2013-01-07 00:25:08] <bakpak2hvy> $ file twitter.jpg
[2013-01-07 00:25:09] <bakpak2hvy> twitter.jpg: data
[2013-01-07 00:25:13] <bakpak2hvy> dafuq
[2013-01-07 00:25:18] <bakpak2hvy> never seen that one before
[2013-01-07 00:25:18] <Lesmo> Ah... just did, in powershell, a split on ":" and then trim them
[2013-01-07 00:25:25] <miklja> maybe when the dump is complete...
[2013-01-07 00:25:26] <fasd> so whats with all the 5s? 5 mins per tweet, .05 sec between each prime
[2013-01-07 00:25:36] <leakhmskill> 5 is prime
[2013-01-07 00:25:49] <hofstadter> 465 tweets...
[2013-01-07 00:25:51] <CheeseFingers> new msg on twitter
[2013-01-07 00:25:53] <leakhmskill> balls
[2013-01-07 00:25:54] <iIIustrious> haha
[2013-01-07 00:25:56] <Kashue> yep
[2013-01-07 00:25:56] <iIIustrious> yep
[2013-01-07 00:25:58] <iIIustrious> still going
[2013-01-07 00:25:59] <miklja> Told you
[2013-01-07 00:26:00] <CheeseFingers> pfff
[2013-01-07 00:26:05] <Kashue> lol
[2013-01-07 00:26:06] <bakpak2hvy> damn it
[2013-01-07 00:26:11] <leakhmskill> the mystery continues
[2013-01-07 00:26:12] <Cuboid3301> -_-
[2013-01-07 00:26:13] =-= miklja is now known as NikT
[2013-01-07 00:26:17] <rb9269> did someone have a go of the pairing? the two pauses in the iso file?
[2013-01-07 00:26:21] <Lesmo> lol... I guess tweet seconds are not relevant
[2013-01-07 00:26:23] <leakhmskill> can we entertain my idea now?
[2013-01-07 00:26:35] <NikT> Im telling you, its definitely an age
[2013-01-07 00:26:41] <NikT> Image*
[2013-01-07 00:26:47] <hofstadter> all theories should be entertained
[2013-01-07 00:27:03] <hofstadter> even if it's for a brief second
[2013-01-07 00:27:17] <leakhmskill> my idea is, most tweets are a mess that can't be decoded
[2013-01-07 00:27:30] <leakhmskill> and specific tweets are the ones we are looking for
[2013-01-07 00:27:40] <bakpak2hvy> http://pastebin.archlinux.fr/455157
[2013-01-07 00:27:45] <leakhmskill> and using the hints we have found so far, we get the right tweets
[2013-01-07 00:27:52] <bakpak2hvy> ^data from twitter.jpg someone mentioned earlier
[2013-01-07 00:28:43] <leakhmskill> the twitter will run on forever, but stop spitting out useful tweets, just more stuff we can't decode
[2013-01-07 00:28:54] <leakhmskill> or decodes into nothing
[2013-01-07 00:29:00] <bakpak2hvy> ^
[2013-01-07 00:29:08] <rb9269> so what are the correct tweets then?
[2013-01-07 00:29:14] <fasd> I still think that it is an authentication code
[2013-01-07 00:29:17] <rb9269> how many tweets should we be looking for?
[2013-01-07 00:29:19] <Cooper_> prime numbers?
[2013-01-07 00:29:19] <leakhmskill> I think it has to with the headers
[2013-01-07 00:29:20] <hofstadter> there are 13 digits in the twitter handle and 13 is prime if that helps at all
[2013-01-07 00:29:39] <bakpak2hvy> i think scrounger is having some sort of breakthrough in hackers
[2013-01-07 00:29:41] <bakpak2hvy> or hes high
[2013-01-07 00:29:42] <leakhmskill> we need to use commonalities between from previous steps and hints
[2013-01-07 00:29:54] <leakhmskill> primes, palindromes

[2013-01-07 01:03:10] <Lurker69> scrounger	No, not coincidence. The hint is about a "beast", then that hint leads us to an ISO with 66601 sectors? and 666 is the beast's number?

[2013-01-07 02:13:14] <Lurker69> i have read about it somwere i forgot  where but that info stayed in my mind for ome reason
[2013-01-07 02:14:16] <Lurker69> so if you post your pot garden on internet be sure to resave image few times in png  and clear it of the exiff
[2013-01-07 02:14:38] <immortalghost> i usually take a screenshot of the origional

[2013-01-07 02:36:16] <Lurker69> i put some things aabout it on wiki

[2013-01-07 02:38:52] <Lurker69> i need to  sign up in wiki, that captcha is a$$
[2013-01-07 02:39:04] <Kenodox> i have been scrolling through the wiki and about 5 other related links and I think I am having an epiphany
[2013-01-07 02:39:33] <fasd> do tell
[2013-01-07 02:40:03] <Kenodox> the message: "@1231507051321  The key is all around you.  Good luck.  3301" led us to the twitter, and we need a key to crack the hexadecimal, right?
[2013-01-07 02:40:17] <Kenodox> the riddle says that "the key is all around you"
[2013-01-07 02:40:37] <Kenodox> and quite literally, the music playing during the image boot is all around you!
[2013-01-07 02:40:55] <Kenodox> the wiki says the song was in "g", so maybe the key is g
[2013-01-07 02:41:02] <lulzorz> Kenodox: the twitter isn't encoded, it's just fucked up jpeg
[2013-01-07 02:41:04] <lulzorz> >music played during image boot
[2013-01-07 02:41:05] <lulzorz> lolwat
[2013-01-07 02:41:17] <Absence_> ^
[2013-01-07 02:41:57] <Kenodox> wait no the music was from another file
[2013-01-07 02:41:58] <BlackJesus> do you even cicada?
[2013-01-07 02:41:58] <Kenodox> I got mixed up sorry
[2013-01-07 02:42:04] <Absence_> So what does it mean all round you? Physically or virtually?
[2013-01-07 02:42:18] <BlackJesus> both?
[2013-01-07 02:42:25] <Guest3181> shed our circumferences
[2013-01-07 02:42:26] <BlackJesus> is that possible?
[2013-01-07 02:42:38] <BlackJesus> like a circumscision or something?
[2013-01-07 02:42:48] <Absence_> lol.
[2013-01-07 02:42:49] <fasd> I just put one of the tweets into a packet hexdump decoder and the address said "How"
[2013-01-07 02:42:55] <Guest3181> we are going in circles
[2013-01-07 02:43:01] <BlackJesus> fasd: wat
[2013-01-07 02:43:01] <Guest3181> circumference as in circles
[2013-01-07 02:43:06] <BlackJesus> this might be something
[2013-01-07 02:43:30] <BlackJesus> fasd: what hexdump thing are you using?
[2013-01-07 02:44:16] <Absence_> did anyone markdown the 464th tweet? Want to see what happens when you decode that one.
[2013-01-07 02:44:21] <fasd> http://sadjad.me/phd/
[2013-01-07 02:44:26] <Guest3181> any theories on the divinity within?
[2013-01-07 02:44:49] <Kenodox> yes, the divinity within means the divine ratio, or the golden ratio
[2013-01-07 02:44:55] <fasd> im just throwing shit in there and looking at what pops out
[2013-01-07 02:45:03] <Kenodox> or at least that was the general consensus last night
[2013-01-07 02:45:21] <c4_> Which tweet did you put into it?
[2013-01-07 02:46:24] <fasd> cant remember sorry
[2013-01-07 02:46:36] <BlackJesus> pick a random one and do it again
[2013-01-07 02:46:37] <c4_> No worries
[2013-01-07 02:46:41] <BlackJesus> i cant use this thing to save my life

[2013-01-07 02:48:20] <Kenodox> do the very first tweet
[2013-01-07 02:48:32] <lulzorz> you can decode that and hexdump it if you want

[2013-01-07 02:48:38] <fasd> i found that if i decode the tweet from ASCII to hex then but it in the packet decoder thing i normaly get some weird stuff

[2013-01-07 02:58:36] <Kenodox> and also, IEEE 802.3 is ethernet, which is an internet protocol
[2013-01-07 02:58:41] <fasd> I took the tweet "b6adc7315efff8ee8b1f4d9770c59cebb231f33a246d1afaa9f77aa0342c375f746c42c9796c45d3c3455e4983c0596d9125839ee82c02a6694c8de9b0e1840130" and decoded it from ASCII to hex
[2013-01-07 02:59:09] <Lesmo> ... what??
[2013-01-07 02:59:16] <Lesmo> You mean the other way around?

[2013-01-07 03:02:40] <Kenodox> fasd, i put it through as well, and the EEEI 802.3 part means that it was using ethernet protocols, and the FlexusCo_ part meant that FlexusCo is one of the website hosts it tracked the hex to

[2013-01-07 03:22:08] <Lurker69> but you have all thelinks images and tekst you could need in pastebin

[2013-01-07 03:25:46] <Lurker69> yes lines are almost the same
[2013-01-07 03:25:48] <immortalghost> my theory n the increase
[2013-01-07 03:26:02] <immortalghost> is that itll keep increasing so we get them all sooner

[2013-01-07 03:26:39] <c4_> As I can't see it anywhere else in the tweets and hadn't seen it discussed
[2013-01-07 03:26:55] <Absence_> To a prior discussion; we've came up with the theory that all images have a possibility of linking together. Soon they will diminish in difference, but as of yet no one can confirm this.

[2013-01-07 03:31:10] <_antelope_> Do we have a count on how many tweets were put out before it changed?

[2013-01-07 03:32:56] <Absence_> No, but it occured at 7:56 (using 1 six minute interval going from 7:50 then to 7:56 probably to keep an orderly schedule).
[2013-01-07 03:33:01] <_antelope_> Anyway, with the amount of tweets we can rule out the possibility that they all carry some coded message

[2013-01-07 03:34:43] <sr01> they still transfer the jpg
[2013-01-07 03:34:51] <sr01> only now its sped up
[2013-01-07 03:35:00] <Absence_> Thats what we figured.
[2013-01-07 03:35:07] <sr01> oh
[2013-01-07 03:35:18] <_antelope_> the first tweet was at 12:45
[2013-01-07 03:35:20] <bak|afk> Lurker69: is it cool if i credit you in the reddit posts?
[2013-01-07 03:35:54] <Absence_> Me?
[2013-01-07 03:36:02] <Absence_> oh lurker
[2013-01-07 03:36:05] <Absence_> didnt see the name loll
[2013-01-07 03:36:06] <bak|afk> whoever wrote the pastebin
[2013-01-07 03:36:28] <Absence_> eh, it can probably be changed.
[2013-01-07 03:38:21] <_antelope_> maybe we should just wait on the twitter account. . .
[2013-01-07 03:38:32] <bak|afk> to do what?
[2013-01-07 03:38:40] <bak|afk> its past when we thought it would stop
[2013-01-07 03:38:51] <_antelope_> well if its getting faster,
[2013-01-07 03:39:02] <_antelope_> something will eventually happen
[2013-01-07 03:39:36] <fasd> again, there is no way they would expect us to just sit on our hands and do nothing
[2013-01-07 03:40:30] <Absence_> If it goes faster then nothing changed but the process speed, unless it has a drastic change from 4 minutes to 10 seconds, we have nothing to worry about. More minds can't hurt; lets just hope they aren't dumb.
[2013-01-07 03:41:10] <_antelope_> I don't know
[2013-01-07 03:41:36] <_antelope_> maybe waiting on the twitter would leave only the dedicated people at the end
[2013-01-07 03:42:26] <_antelope_> at which point the account would release some vital piece of information
[2013-01-07 03:42:53] <_antelope_> don't mind me, just thinking out loud

[2013-01-07 03:46:45] <Dafodilianv>  I had a theory that the tweets might be chess moves
[2013-01-07 03:47:11] <Lurker69> i donr know fow cooper got ()*56789:CDEFGHIJSTUVWXY  from tweets
[2013-01-07 03:47:25] <Absence_> chess moves? describe.

[2013-01-07 03:47:52] <Lurker69> on the other hand i dont understang hoe that hex ascii utf 8 conversions work at all
[2013-01-07 03:47:53] <_antelope_> chess moves are at least something new to look at

[2013-01-07 03:48:46] <Dafodilianv> I don't know if it was followed up, but I mentioned earlier the four digits of 3301/ 1033 pi/phi in the tweets
[2013-01-07 03:48:47] <_antelope_> tangent like offtopic, i believe
[2013-01-07 03:48:53] <leakhmskill> how could it be chess moves?
[2013-01-07 03:48:58] <c4_> There was a thing of wiki for 464 relating to chess
[2013-01-07 03:49:04] <Dafodilianv> Chess moves are also 4 digits
[2013-01-07 03:49:07] <c4_> I think it was total legal moves for a king or somthing
[2013-01-07 03:49:12] <Dafodilianv> from 1-9  to a-f
[2013-01-07 03:49:14] <leakhmskill> oh yeah, 464 legal moves for a king
[2013-01-07 03:49:24] <Dafodilianv> No, chess movoes themselves
[2013-01-07 03:49:26] <leakhmskill> I remember reading that

[2013-01-07 03:49:36] <Dafodilianv> like Kne5

[2013-01-07 03:49:51] <Dafodilianv> examine the wiki link
[2013-01-07 03:49:52] <c4_> So you think this is playing out a chess game?
[2013-01-07 03:50:01] <leakhmskill> anyone good at chess?
[2013-01-07 03:50:04] <Dafodilianv> dunno, it may be referencing moves or figures
[2013-01-07 03:50:13] <Dafodilianv> I am somewhat knowleadgable on it
[2013-01-07 03:50:15] <_antelope_> I know the move syntax

[2013-01-07 03:50:32] <Dafodilianv> But understand, I thought of this after reading a recent wiki article, one of those new trending ones
[2013-01-07 03:50:36] <Dafodilianv> for magnus carlsen
[2013-01-07 03:50:42] <_antelope_> but it's probably just showing up randomly in the hex
[2013-01-07 03:50:45] <leakhmskill> http://www.chesslab.com/PositionSearch.html
[2013-01-07 03:50:46] <Dafodilianv> and chess moves have a lot of primes/0's
[2013-01-07 03:50:47] <Absence_> that would mean the twitter played out 514 moves already
[2013-01-07 03:50:55] <Dafodilianv> Not necessarily
[2013-01-07 03:50:58] <Absence_> you said there is only 464 moves in total.
[2013-01-07 03:51:03] <Dafodilianv> no I didn't
[2013-01-07 03:51:05] <Dafodilianv> wait  a sec
[2013-01-07 03:51:07] <Dafodilianv> look at the link
[2013-01-07 03:51:25] <_antelope_> 464 were the primes from the boot sequence
[2013-01-07 03:51:29] <leakhmskill> I think this will take chess format
[2013-01-07 03:51:31] <Dafodilianv> On 26 April 2004, Carlsen became a Grandmaster at the age of 13 years, 148 days,
[2013-01-07 03:51:33] <leakhmskill> and move the pieces
[2013-01-07 03:51:59] <leakhmskill> does someone have the pastebin of the twitter posts?

[2013-01-07 03:54:26] <leakhmskill> black would have to start first
[2013-01-07 03:54:28] <_antelope_> Dafodilanv: keep going

[2013-01-07 03:55:02] <Dafodilianv> Chess is often in sets of four games
[2013-01-07 03:55:22] <Dafodilianv> Look at the page, there's a lot of relations, possibly imagined, but I saw something Instar related ima find
[2013-01-07 03:55:25] <sr01> 500 moves?
[2013-01-07 03:55:29] <sr01> unlikely
[2013-01-07 03:55:57] <leakhmskill> maybe each tweet is a complete game
[2013-01-07 03:56:04] <_antelope_> it may not be a conventional chess game

[2013-01-07 03:56:44] <_antelope_> i doubt each tweet is a game, there would be more variation in text length
[2013-01-07 03:57:02] <leakhmskill> also, the numbers go to 9
[2013-01-07 03:57:11] <leakhmskill> and chess boards are 8x8
[2013-01-07 03:57:15] <leakhmskill> not possible
[2013-01-07 03:57:45] <leakhmskill> and there are massive strings of just numbers, no letters
[2013-01-07 03:58:05] <Dafodilianv>  Peer Gynt Prize - PGP, still have that instar thing to find

[2013-01-07 03:58:57] <leakhmskill> that seems excessive, even for cicada

[2013-01-07 03:59:41] <Dafodilianv> n the NH Chess Tournament held in Amsterdam in August, Carlsen participated in an "Experience" v "Rising Stars" Scheveningen team match. The "Rising Stars" won the match 22–28,   instars/ rising stars correlates to the theme of emergence

[2013-01-07 03:59:52] <leakhmskill> well, tweets max at 140 characters no matter what
[2013-01-07 04:00:01] <leakhmskill> so they're bound to be similar lengths
[2013-01-07 04:00:28] <scrounger> So... we're talking abut chess instead of trying to solve the JPG thing? Sweet!
[2013-01-07 04:00:46] <leakhmskill> we dropped the jpg thing for now
[2013-01-07 04:00:55] <leakhmskill> trying to find different meanings
[2013-01-07 04:01:02] <_antelope_> we needed a diversion
[2013-01-07 04:01:03] <Dafodilianv> This win, the third time Carlsen had won the tournament in the past four years, increased his rating from 2848 to a new record of 2861, breaking Kasparov's 13-year record of 2851
[2013-01-07 04:01:15] <Dafodilianv> By rating performance, this was one of the best results in history, with a performance rating of 2994
[2013-01-07 04:01:50] <leakhmskill> by the way, to continue my theme of palindromes, cicada is made of two palindromes, cic and ada
[2013-01-07 04:02:00] <_antelope_> ok. . .
[2013-01-07 04:02:10] <n00b_> Sorry, I'm just joinging in. Which .jpg?
[2013-01-07 04:02:12] <Dafodilianv> Hey i've been out of the loop thinkin of shit all day, I just noticed the correlation between the fact we can find relevant four-character parses in the tweets and chess is based around four-character moves and four-character dates
[2013-01-07 04:02:21] <leakhmskill> I'm shooting in the dark here man
[2013-01-07 04:02:27] <Dafodilianv> Also, they gravitate towards primes naturally
[2013-01-07 04:02:37] <leakhmskill> yeah, palindromes and primes
[2013-01-07 04:03:03] <leakhmskill> what is standard chess notation for a random move?
[2013-01-07 04:03:10] <leakhmskill> well, any move
[2013-01-07 04:03:26] <_antelope_> letter followed by number
[2013-01-07 04:03:39] <leakhmskill> in 2 letter or 4 letter groupings?
[2013-01-07 04:03:41] <_antelope_> b6
[2013-01-07 04:03:50] <Dafodilianv> And on the topic of finding clues in the "raw" tweets, we haven't really any external codex to work with, right, and the fact that we found 3301, 1033, pi, and phi, each once and only once, four characters each, must be significant
[2013-01-07 04:03:59] <_antelope_> usually white and black moves are grouped
[2013-01-07 04:04:12] <_antelope_> e4 e5
[2013-01-07 04:04:24] <Dafodilianv> examine these
[2013-01-07 04:04:25] <Dafodilianv> gxf7
[2013-01-07 04:04:26] <leakhmskill> but how do you know what moved to that spot?
[2013-01-07 04:04:32] <Dafodilianv> It's to remove ambiguity and increase flow
[2013-01-07 04:05:04] <leakhmskill> if two pieces could both go to e4, how do you know which one makes the move?
[2013-01-07 04:05:05] <n00b_> The moves couldn't be referencing a specific game, could they?
[2013-01-07 04:05:22] <_antelope_> We can't be sure of exactly what type of chess syntax is being used
[2013-01-07 04:05:41] <scrounger> leakhmskill, that's actually really interesting. i hadn't noticed that before!

[2013-01-07 04:05:57] <leakhmskill> interesting read
[2013-01-07 04:05:59] <_antelope_> but if it was like gxf7, wouldn't the x be used disproportionately much?
[2013-01-07 04:06:01] <n00b_> Maybe if we start at the beginning of the game, there would only be one real option for what could move there
[2013-01-07 04:06:11] <leakhmskill> capital letters are the piece
[2013-01-07 04:06:29] <leakhmskill> then, the lower case and number are the square
[2013-01-07 04:06:50] <leakhmskill> pawns don't have capital letters
[2013-01-07 04:07:08] <leakhmskill> X means capturing a piece
[2013-01-07 04:07:25] <Dafodilianv> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_notation
[2013-01-07 04:07:26] <pr0> so u guys sure this is the tweets?
[2013-01-07 04:07:38] <Dafodilianv>  PGN is used when working with computer chess programs.
[2013-01-07 04:07:51] <n00b_> Ok, so do we just set up a chess board for a new game, then follow the notation?
[2013-01-07 04:07:53] <_antelope_> pic is PGN. . .
[2013-01-07 04:07:55] <leakhmskill> but
[2013-01-07 04:08:08] <leakhmskill> there are no pluses or symbols to indicate checks
[2013-01-07 04:08:11] <leakhmskill> or checkmates
[2013-01-07 04:08:18] <n00b_> What if it isn't the entire game yet?
[2013-01-07 04:08:23] <Dafodilianv> But the moves themselves do
[2013-01-07 04:08:25] <Dafodilianv> If we have a board
[2013-01-07 04:08:29] <_antelope_> it could just be openings. . .
[2013-01-07 04:08:33] <Dafodilianv> and we know the positons
[2013-01-07 04:08:35] <Dafodilianv> then we know the game
[2013-01-07 04:08:59] <leakhmskill> okay, but there are long strings of numbers, then strings of letters
[2013-01-07 04:09:13] <n00b_> So... anyone have a chess board? I can probably find one online
[2013-01-07 04:09:22] <_antelope_> Yes, not everything is a move
[2013-01-07 04:09:23] <Dafodilianv> Minimal algebraic notation (MAN) is similar to SAN but omits the indicators for capture ("x") and check ("+"). It was used by Chess Informant.
[2013-01-07 04:09:31] <leakhmskill> I don't think it is chess
[2013-01-07 04:09:40] <Dafodilianv> Yes, I have a chessboard, I am going to sit back, blaze a bowl, and investigate further
[2013-01-07 04:09:51] <Dafodilianv> also man/ manu, which is a tournament
[2013-01-07 04:09:59] <leakhmskill> we can try MAN, it seems to be the cloest, but I don't think chess had anyting to do with it
[2013-01-07 04:10:04] <_antelope_> ^ this man is doing it right
[2013-01-07 04:10:31] <Dafodilianv> I'm just glad I can articulate my theories in a way they're slightly plausible
[2013-01-07 04:10:59] <Dafodilianv> But what was the jpg thing? 'cause I didn't get an answer on that
[2013-01-07 04:11:24] <_antelope_> We are on an anonymous message board discussing an almost impossible theory

[2013-01-07 04:11:46] <_antelope_> but we just keep going
[2013-01-07 04:11:50] <Dafodilianv> Everything cicada related is implausible and nigh-impossible

[2013-01-07 04:14:16] <leakhmskill> we could use some fresh minds

[2013-01-07 04:15:57] <leakhmskill> I feel proud
[2013-01-07 04:16:03] <Dafodilianv> And besides, wasn't the idea to make a chat, scan it, and invite the smart posters to join in the LOW NOISE HIGH SIGNAL TOGETHER AS ONE DIVIDED BY ZERO sections
[2013-01-07 04:16:42] <sr01> it was
[2013-01-07 04:16:49] <sr01> poster kinda fucked up
[2013-01-07 04:16:58] <n00b_> is 761 a prime number?
[2013-01-07 04:17:08] <Dafodilianv> Smith notation is a straightforward chess notation designed to be reversible and represent any move without ambiguity. The notation encodes the from square, to square, and what piece was captured, if any. - REVERSIBLE
[2013-01-07 04:17:11] <Dafodilianv> an example:
[2013-01-07 04:17:19] <Dafodilianv> e2e4 e7e5
[2013-01-07 04:17:29] <n00b_> It is
[2013-01-07 04:17:33] <leakhmskill> 761 is a prime
[2013-01-07 04:17:53] <c4_> Sounding good daf
[2013-01-07 04:17:59] <n00b_> Should we be keeping an eye out for other numbers showing up on that list hen?
[2013-01-07 04:18:05] <leakhmskill> who is working on the chess stuff?
[2013-01-07 04:18:28] <Dafodilianv> Me
[2013-01-07 04:18:33] <Dafodilianv> Should I go to riddler?
[2013-01-07 04:18:34] <Dafodilianv> Portable Game Notation (PGN) is a plain text computer-processible format for recording chess games (both the moves and related data), supported by many chess programs.
[2013-01-07 04:18:44] <leakhmskill> not sure

[2013-01-07 04:18:58] <leakhmskill> if you need any help, I'm doing nothing
[2013-01-07 04:19:02] <Absence_> Doesn't really seem logical to me.
[2013-01-07 04:19:03] <c4_> May aswell do it where everyone is looking for now
[2013-01-07 04:19:25] <Dafodilianv> TimeControl: "40/7200:3600" (moves per seconds: sudden death seconds)
[2013-01-07 04:19:25] <Absence_> so what EXACTLY do you think/assume the twitter is printing?

[2013-01-07 04:19:56] <leakhmskill> post*
[2013-01-07 04:20:02] <leakhmskill> but we could explore the ches idea
[2013-01-07 04:20:16] <leakhmskill> although I have no idea how chess does anything for us
[2013-01-07 04:20:35] <fasd> packets from pings to random sites
[2013-01-07 04:20:40] <Dafodilianv> PGN data for archival storage is required to provide seven bracketed fields, referred to as "tags" and together known as the STR (Seven Tag Roster). I - 7 was relevant earlier, bracketed - circumferenced, which is also surrounded, which is Checkmate
[2013-01-07 04:20:43] <Absence_> It doesn't seem like cicada would go to chess
[2013-01-07 04:21:08] <c4_> Why not?
[2013-01-07 04:21:16] <pr0> seems like a jpg
[2013-01-07 04:21:22] <fasd> it could also be some sort of authentication
[2013-01-07 04:21:23] <n00b_> I don't know about you, but I havn't seen why they wouldn't
[2013-01-07 04:22:00] <leakhmskill> I say we let hackers handle the jpg
[2013-01-07 04:22:12] <leakhmskill> and riddlers handle the chess

[2013-01-07 04:22:39] <Dafodilianv> Is 60 a relevant number?
[2013-01-07 04:23:49] <leakhmskill> not that I can see
[2013-01-07 04:24:01] <n00b_> I'm not sure. The fact it isn't prime makes me doubt it, but maybe
[2013-01-07 04:24:18] <Dafodilianv> I think that chess is very relevant, it's a numeric, strategic, "intelligent", and very prime game of individual competition, each board and move is a new puzzle. But ima take this to Riddler now
[2013-01-07 04:24:51] <leakhmskill> hackers does not like the idea of chess
[2013-01-07 04:24:53] <leakhmskill> lol
[2013-01-07 04:24:54] <n00b_> We may have to wait until all of the parts are posted to Twitter, and collect them in a .txt file, then convert it to a jpeg
[2013-01-07 04:25:16] <leakhmskill> well, who knows when the twitter is going to stop?
[2013-01-07 04:25:39] <Dafodilianv> I'm a riddler, I gather data and analyse it, I have no neat tricks or machines to do things for me, I'm just trying to form systems of logic out of chaos

[2013-01-07 04:26:13] <leakhmskill> I still think we need to be sorting the twitter posts

[2013-01-07 04:51:50] <scrounger> pr0, this is second year they've done this. same PGP sigs. it's legit.
[2013-01-07 04:52:09] <scrounger> i worked on it last year for a while but fell behind because school.
[2013-01-07 04:52:09] <Bloodbane> In fact this has all been repeated over the past in numerous occasions, I even have an old archive of someone whom cracked a case... then dissapeared.
[2013-01-07 04:52:26] <scrounger> Bloodbane, post it, please?
[2013-01-07 04:52:44] <Cosmo_> I'm taking that old mp3 into a university sound lab tomorrow. I'm not convinced everything that can be had from that is available yet.
[2013-01-07 04:52:44] <Bloodbane> Let me dig it up, I have to encrypt these things ya know.
[2013-01-07 04:53:10] <leakhmskill> I think we could get more from the audio
[2013-01-07 04:53:37] <Flumentia> OK, I get the feeling that if we can work out these twitter messages, then they'll all combine to create some kind of file. We just need all of the dumps completed.
[2013-01-07 04:53:43] <Cosmo_> Luckily I'm in a uniquely well placed position to have another look at that mp3.
[2013-01-07 04:53:44] <n00b_> @cosmo Do you think that maybe there could be an algorythm hidden in the music?
[2013-01-07 04:54:44] <Bloodbane> Sadly by sources unmentionable i am not allowed to upload or distribute the archives. They contain sensitive information that the group i beling into has highly valued and classified as confidential.
[2013-01-07 04:54:48] <Cosmo_> I was actually going to approach it from the more obvious end. The 'reverse' effects are what's intrigueing me. Usually those random note patterns reversed fit to enhance a sound, but in terms of this mp3 they slide off key in seemingly random places
[2013-01-07 04:54:51] <Flumentia> What scares me most about this is that 3301 is/are watching us right now as we solve it.

[2013-01-07 05:07:38] <Cosmo_> the other group is of strings posted in reply to OP or under 'heaven;

[2013-01-07 05:10:56] <Dafodilianv> Ranting with references to quite a lot of things, seems more like a red herring

[2013-01-07 05:13:02] <Flumentia> Looks like 3301 stopped posting on that /b/ thread. I'd wish instead of making it more complicated, they'd simplify it...
[2013-01-07 05:13:10] <gentoomen> Some random video being shown to homer about the world ending with people going crazy or whatnot

[2013-01-07 05:25:02] <c4_> In this http://pastebin.com/dHJ6JNkr it's written that "They [cicada] believe that within each person there is a "God." Not "God" in the sense of most religions, it is more like Übermensch in the writings of Nietzsche. They also see the Global Brain as another kind of "God"" Could this be a further meaning of "Find the divinity within"?

[2013-01-07 06:22:55] <leakhmskill> because it dropped to 2 minutes at one point
[2013-01-07 06:22:59] <leakhmskill> then went back to five

[2013-01-07 06:32:35] <anonalaala> honestly there's got to be a way to identify the song.  I haven't shazam'd it but /mu/ didn't turn up anything, all my hipster buddies don't know it

[2013-01-07 06:33:16] <anonalaala> I could be wrong, but I don't think someone at Cicada just decided to write and perform a song

[2013-01-07 06:40:15] <JackHinds> did you normalize it?

[2013-01-07 06:41:16] <Cosmo_> Why normalise it? If there's something there you'll lose it
[2013-01-07 06:41:28] <JackHinds> lol
[2013-01-07 06:41:30] <JackHinds> how's that?
[2013-01-07 06:41:58] <Cosmo_> Normalising in audacity is setting a limit and reducing the peaks and bringing the dips to the same level
[2013-01-07 06:42:13] <Cosmo_> It makes the quiet bits loud and the loud bits quiet
[2013-01-07 06:42:33] <Lurker69>  i dont know much about audio engineering but  people skilled in it said that song is palindrmoic, when i asked if that means that reverse  is the same they told that not exactly but that if you play them both they cancel each other...
[2013-01-07 06:42:34] <JackHinds> then i guess audacity is shitty
[2013-01-07 06:42:37] <JackHinds> try soundforge
[2013-01-07 06:42:42] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, that's compression
[2013-01-07 06:42:46] <JackHinds> you can't lose sound
[2013-01-07 06:42:56] <Cosmo_> No compression is setting a peak.

[2013-01-07 06:46:22] <Cosmo_> A square wave spends longer at a higher amplitude because without it's gradient, it's got a higher 'on' time
[2013-01-07 06:46:29] <Cosmo_> it's not louder, there's just more of it

[2013-01-07 06:47:45] <JackHinds> i got an idea
[2013-01-07 06:47:46] <Cosmo_> It's not palindromic, and I've just noticed that both stereo tracks have slight variations
[2013-01-07 06:47:55] <Cosmo_> That's unusual for an mp3 as it is.
[2013-01-07 06:48:10] <JackHinds> did you play them both at the same time, one normal and one reverse?
[2013-01-07 06:48:26] <soulseekah> has anyone got an image of the spetrogram of the song?
[2013-01-07 06:48:34] <Cosmo_> Yep, I'm hearing nothing so unusual it jumps out at me, but I'm going to get another looks later

[2013-01-07 06:49:34] <JackHinds> till the end
[2013-01-07 06:49:47] <JackHinds> it sounds better in a way that resembles the original music better
[2013-01-07 06:49:50] <JackHinds> they slowed it down
[2013-01-07 06:50:01] <JackHinds> i think they want us to identify the origin of the song

[2013-01-07 07:09:04] <Cosmo_> I find those bpms to be very intentional. It's clear the guitarist is playing to a click track or metronome.
[2013-01-07 07:09:13] <JackHinds> also
[2013-01-07 07:09:16] <JackHinds> there's constant reversing
[2013-01-07 07:09:26] <JackHinds> constant switching between normal and reverse
[2013-01-07 07:09:52] <Cosmo_> Yeah I just looked into the reversing. All I've noticed is there are two instruments being reversed. One is the guitar itself, sliding up and down one string
[2013-01-07 07:09:59] <Cosmo_> the other sounds like a dodouk

[2013-01-07 07:12:20] <JackHinds> i speeded up the last part
[2013-01-07 07:12:24] <JackHinds> and it sounds like it should
[2013-01-07 07:12:26] <indigo_> the name of the mp3 is the second count reversed, thats even more reversing
[2013-01-07 07:12:32] <indigo_> try reversing the zip name
[2013-01-07 07:13:23] <maxxtro9> is it just me or at 00:42 it seems to skip a bit of the song? Sounds like a mistake while playing
[2013-01-07 07:13:57] <Cosmo_> I don't understand, if all these poems are about growth and stuff, why are they so obsessed with going backwards? Since when are regression and evolution the same thing?

[2013-01-07 07:24:12] <Lurker69> [07:22]	JackHinds	what about the data files from the iso?   good question... no real info on them yet
[2013-01-07 07:24:17] <soulseekah> interesting part at offset 000028a as pointed out by Flumentia I think
[2013-01-07 07:24:23] <soulseekah> looks like some sort of padding
[2013-01-07 07:24:31] <JackHinds> lurker
[2013-01-07 07:24:31] <soulseekah> for a metadata chunk
[2013-01-07 07:24:38] <JackHinds> can you voice me on the other channel?
[2013-01-07 07:25:13] <Flumentia> Yes. This is definitely a file.
[2013-01-07 07:25:22] <JackHinds> cosmo
[2013-01-07 07:25:25] <JackHinds> did you listen to it?
[2013-01-07 07:25:25] <soulseekah> and the start does seem to be a header overall
[2013-01-07 07:25:36] <Fasd> Has anyone else noticed that the ending numbers (.00 .13 .17) match up perfectly with the emergence cycles to cicada (the 00 refers to the periodical emergence cycle)
[2013-01-07 07:25:57] <Flumentia> Shit that 000028a bit is pretty much throughout that string or a cut version of it.

[2013-01-07 07:26:46] <soulseekah> 28a is just an offset as I see it
[2013-01-07 07:27:18] <soulseekah> but the data is rather strangely self-referrant
[2013-01-07 07:27:29] <soulseekah> it keeps on repeating around offset 28a

[2013-01-07 07:43:35] <soulseekah> I did do a couple of edits
[2013-01-07 07:43:39] <Flumentia> Just opened that .raw in photoshop, I can confirm it's most probably some sort of file. All of the 0028a's create a very weird top part to it...
[2013-01-07 07:43:41] <soulseekah> in the wiki about the twitter
[2013-01-07 07:43:50] <soulseekah> but it's not a JPG, nothing to indicate it to be a jpg so far
[2013-01-07 07:43:56] <Asa> 1,595,277,641 what about reversing these, use roman numbers then caesar cipher them?

[2013-01-07 07:44:41] <soulseekah> so?
[2013-01-07 07:44:50] <Flumentia> It seems odd
[2013-01-07 07:44:56] <soulseekah> maxxtro9, not an indication of a JPG
[2013-01-07 07:45:03] <maxxtro9> just odd
[2013-01-07 07:45:08] <Flumentia> But if it were deliberate it would either be a palindrome or a prime number
[2013-01-07 07:45:11] <soulseekah> although bears some resemblance to meta headers for JFIF
[2013-01-07 07:45:34] <Lurker69> soulseekah: so no jpg in your opinion?
[2013-01-07 07:45:40] <soulseekah> for now no
[2013-01-07 07:46:13] <Lesmo> I think tweet chunks have to be ordered
[2013-01-07 07:46:14] <Lurker69> but but resemblance to meta headers for JFIF
[2013-01-07 07:46:35] <soulseekah> resemblance, many formats have such padding in meta data areas
[2013-01-07 07:46:36] <Lesmo> Maybe other format?
[2013-01-07 07:46:51] <soulseekah> look trhough http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures for patterns
[2013-01-07 07:46:56] <soulseekah> so far I've found none
[2013-01-07 07:47:06] <soulseekah> but the data may be encrypted
[2013-01-07 07:47:59] <soulseekah> trying to offset the byte values by +01..02 etc.
[2013-01-07 07:48:10] <soulseekah> simple shift cipher
[2013-01-07 07:48:26] <soulseekah> but once the tweets stop we can assume to have complete data we can try PGP
[2013-01-07 07:48:36] <soulseekah> which is highly probably
[2013-01-07 07:48:47] <alexanderthegrea> assuming the tweets do stop

[2013-01-07 07:50:34] <Lurker69> that looks the same as for jpgs, but  it is hjust padding
[2013-01-07 07:50:43] <soulseekah> Lurker69, interesting thoughts
[2013-01-07 07:50:52] <soulseekah> let's see now
[2013-01-07 07:51:04] <soulseekah> say we disregard the headers
[2013-01-07 07:51:15] <soulseekah> and take a chunk at say offset 0x1000
[2013-01-07 07:51:16] <Lurker69> http://prntscr.com/odo1m  maxxtro9  here on the reght you have opened jpg, samestring is there

[2013-01-07 07:51:47] <onon> Lots of space
[2013-01-07 07:51:47] <onon> Over 10330.
[2013-01-07 07:51:51] <soulseekah> Flumentia, the 7 digit headers are OFFSETS
[2013-01-07 07:51:52] <soulseekah> byte offsets
[2013-01-07 07:51:56] <onon> im going paranoid ^^
[2013-01-07 07:51:56] <soulseekah> 65 bytes each
[2013-01-07 07:52:04] <Lesmo> Yeah, so those shall be ignored.
[2013-01-07 07:52:33] <soulseekah> http://codeseekah.com/cicada/tweets.html contains the "headers" unaltered but are really byte offsets
[2013-01-07 07:52:47] <soulseekah> which points to the theory that the data is ordered
[2013-01-07 07:53:00] <soulseekah> and is coming in top to bottom
[2013-01-07 07:53:13] <Flumentia> OK.
[2013-01-07 07:53:28] <anonalaala> how can they be bite offsets if they're only 7 digits :( this has yet to be explained :(

[2013-01-07 07:56:02] <Flumentia> Here's a big list of file sigs where I found that ...... = .MPG or .VOB: http://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html
[2013-01-07 07:56:25] <soulseekah> now let's think what sort of encoding/encryption would allow for sequences 01...ff and 0a28 repertiion around offset 28a?
[2013-01-07 07:59:29] <soulseekah> one would think that all sorts of symmetrical block/stream cyphers would not be able to leave those artifacts there
[2013-01-07 07:59:30] <Flumentia> I'm going to say GPG, but only because that's what they've always used.
[2013-01-07 07:59:30] <alexanderthegrea> as easy as it would be to say we just have to wait until it finishes and then just translate it from there i think it would 1, rely on it being exactly the size of 0000000-fffffff, and 2, be a lot simpler albeit time consuming than i would expect

[2013-01-07 07:59:32] <brotherBox> Well...it would be a very improbable pattern between ciphertext and plain text. 00-FF is in the hex range and its output could come from anything, if we take more advance statistics out of account.

[2013-01-07 08:12:03] <soulseekah> as I see it there are several strategies we can employ in regards to twitter: a. find the magic number before offset 0x1000 (4096 bytes in), b. try a shift cipher to find a magic number at offset 1
[2013-01-07 08:12:14] <soulseekah> I mean offset 0, sorry
[2013-01-07 08:13:00] <soulseekah> now in regards to the header itself as is we have 2 things: first is the sequence CDEF.... with missing bytes at regular intervals it seems (KLMNOPQR)
[2013-01-07 08:13:13] <Lurker69> what is that "magic number"
[2013-01-07 08:13:26] <maxxtro9> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures
[2013-01-07 08:13:28] <soulseekah> a MAGIC number is an identifier for a filetype
[2013-01-07 08:13:39] <soulseekah> for example all EXEs in windows start with magic bytes MZ
[2013-01-07 08:13:41] <soulseekah> etc.
[2013-01-07 08:13:59] <soulseekah> once we identify the filetype of the data being dumped we can open it with the appropriate reader
[2013-01-07 08:14:10] <Cosmo_> Getting nothing in terms of audio with the Raw data, but without knowing a sample rate to head for it's always just going to come out as bleeps and bloops at best, white noise at worst
[2013-01-07 08:14:13] <soulseekah> be it an image reader, an audio reader or an archive reder

[2013-01-07 08:15:02] <soulseekah> we have 0101 repetitions, 00a28 repetitions
[2013-01-07 08:15:18] <soulseekah> now if we take 00a28 as an actual byte offset and go find it
[2013-01-07 08:15:31] <Lurker69> soulseekah: so lets make list of all the identifier numbers and check for the match...  ar are there too many
[2013-01-07 08:15:36] <soulseekah> it's already past the header
[2013-01-07 08:15:50] <soulseekah> addreses a00 is quite into what I call the "data" part
[2013-01-07 08:16:13] <soulseekah> the "header" part seems to end around offset 0x3co

[2013-01-07 08:31:15] <youdontknow> i tried with notepad++ and it opened fine
[2013-01-07 08:32:52] <soulseekah> ok so .13 looks like a legit format
[2013-01-07 08:32:54] <Lesmo> Yeah, Notepad++ is better at that stuff.
[2013-01-07 08:33:02] <Lesmo> What you mean legit?
[2013-01-07 08:33:05] <soulseekah> with a header and data
[2013-01-07 08:33:21] <soulseekah> lookup 968e bdaf 5267 7a0d 0e21 6f40 4041 414f 5354 as magic numbers

[2013-01-07 08:34:01] <Lesmo> ... or come around and lurk :P
[2013-01-07 08:34:31] <soulseekah> .17 is just data
[2013-01-07 08:34:44] <Lesmo> lol what you mean with "just data"?
[2013-01-07 08:34:50] <maxxtro9> hopefully tomorrow this will still be going on and im not left behind lol
[2013-01-07 08:34:54] <soulseekah> means no evident "header"
[2013-01-07 08:34:59] <soulseekah> unlike .13
[2013-01-07 08:35:00] <Lesmo> Oh, ok.
[2013-01-07 08:35:13] <Lesmo> Have you seen the file sizes?
[2013-01-07 08:35:21] <Lesmo> Two of those files are numeric palindromes.
[2013-01-07 08:35:25] <soulseekah> so what we have is .13 has an evident header of sorts, then the others only data
[2013-01-07 08:35:34] <soulseekah> many formats can be padded
[2013-01-07 08:35:55] <soulseekah> but padding can eliminte a handful of signed formats
[2013-01-07 08:36:40] <youdontknow> tried it as an iso, doesn't appear to be working, .13 that is
[2013-01-07 08:37:37] <Cosmo_> Random info injection. Using your guys most recent raw data from twitter and converting it using GSM 6.10 into audacity creates an apparent random sounding soundscape that fits vocal frequency range. Gonna see if that leads anywhere.
[2013-01-07 08:37:52] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, interesting good luck
[2013-01-07 08:38:39] <soulseekah> what do we know about the given disk image?

[2013-01-07 08:49:37] <Flumentia> Still working through, haven't found anything useful other than that. I'd say it COULD be backwards and that could be a trailer.
[2013-01-07 08:50:09] <soulseekah> could be a footer, but I know of no formats with a footer in them
[2013-01-07 08:50:22] <soulseekah> except signed data perhaps
[2013-01-07 08:50:41] <soulseekah> but it doesn't look anywhere near what we currently have

[2013-01-07 10:25:40] <iIIustrious> I'll take a quick look, otherwise it's fast enough to code it

[2013-01-07 10:35:42] <brotherBox> Perl or Python?
[2013-01-07 10:35:47] <scrounger> so, did you guys read Book of the Law Chapter 2 Line 55?
[2013-01-07 10:35:47] <Lurker69> Elder Futhark is the most ancient Germanic runic alphabet that was in use from the 2nd to 8th centuries by all Germanic tribes. This system of runic writing has a very peculiar and complex inner structure.
[2013-01-07 10:36:03] <brotherBox> Imma do Perl because I can do that better
[2013-01-07 10:36:09] <scrounger> That's not what it says though, Lurker69
[2013-01-07 10:36:13] <Ymgve> scrounger: no, we are kinda busy xoring everything with everything
[2013-01-07 10:36:31] <scrounger> it's in a differnt order than what you're saying, Lurker69
[2013-01-07 10:36:31] <lolxD> uhh... so the tweet are slowly became runic table?
[2013-01-07 10:36:53] <scrounger> Ymgve: gotcha. But you should read it because it relates.  In fact the image seems to be quoting it.
[2013-01-07 10:36:59] <scrounger> I googled it.

[2013-01-07 10:49:54] <AlooGobi> Alright, from what I understand is that this XOR mp3 is a decoder which converts data into a png file? And the file you guys are working on is linked above which is about 1/3 complete?
[2013-01-07 10:49:59] <soulseekah> let me see if I can get a larger image

[2013-01-07 11:00:08] <Lurker69> or is now only 3301 ....

[2013-01-07 11:00:57] <AlooGobi> 00009gag:?
[2013-01-07 11:01:02] <Lurker69> 	https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1593421/3301/testout.jpg  is mp3 xor twitter right?
[2013-01-07 11:01:21] <Ymgve> yeah
[2013-01-07 11:01:47] <Lurker69> so how could you get whole image if we dont have all the tweets yet?
[2013-01-07 11:02:01] <Ymgve> but the full formula is mp3 xor twitter xor 560.13 = base64
[2013-01-07 11:02:02] <Cosmo_> There's another image?
[2013-01-07 11:02:09] <Ymgve> AND
[2013-01-07 11:02:18] <Ymgve> the base64 is actually two parts
[2013-01-07 11:02:28] <Ymgve> first a base64 image, then the text 33010 repeated
[2013-01-07 11:03:15] <AlooGobi> If you look downwards from the top of your screen
[2013-01-07 11:03:15] <Ymgve> I just assumed that it would continue to have 33010 repeated, thus recreating all the data in base64
[2013-01-07 11:03:15] <AlooGobi> there are blemishes in the picture.
[2013-01-07 11:03:23] <Ymgve> and then I took base64 xor 560.13 xor mp3 = twitter
[2013-01-07 11:03:31] <AlooGobi> small outliers?
[2013-01-07 11:04:05] <chimp> < <@Ymgve> and then I took base64 xor 560.13 xor mp3 = twitter  <-- huh?
[2013-01-07 11:04:22] <brotherBox> Thats how xor works.

[2013-01-07 11:05:35] <Cosmo_> So it leaves the question, what's next?
[2013-01-07 11:05:52] <AlooGobi> THIS IS INSANELY FUN
[2013-01-07 11:06:09] <chimp> we have a decoding table
[2013-01-07 11:06:12] <chimp> but no code to decode
[2013-01-07 11:06:15] <chimp> right?
[2013-01-07 11:06:16] <soulseekah> what could 7d35 d37d f4d7 4df mean?
[2013-01-07 11:06:21] <Ymgve> might go to work soon, so this is the next step: the decoding image has a GPG message embedded
[2013-01-07 11:06:24] <Cosmo_> That's how it looks.
[2013-01-07 11:06:34] <Ymgve> the message _appears_ blank, but it actually has a pattern of spaces and tabs
[2013-01-07 11:06:42] <chimp> binary?
[2013-01-07 11:06:44] <Ymgve> I haven't looked at exactly what's hidden there yet

[2013-01-07 11:27:25] <n_factor> the song was the xor key

[2013-01-07 11:28:41] <Cosmo_> The mp3 itself was important
[2013-01-07 11:28:44] <p0lyvalent> Maybe not music, but sound.
[2013-01-07 11:28:57] <Cosmo_> the music......meh, maybe later, but as of yet I've found nothing in there

[2013-01-07 11:29:09] <soulseekah> probably nothing in the music itself

[2013-01-07 11:29:35] <andorraclaim> the riff starts on the third fret
[2013-01-07 11:29:36] <Cosmo_> Oh I isolated the 'breath' sound at the start too, i'm actually pretty sure it's the sound of a group of cicadas

[2013-01-07 12:16:17] <brotherBox> And notify us in that case.
[2013-01-07 12:16:19] <n_factor> if you enter a number prefixed with a 0 it will give you the primes of the number reversed

[2013-01-07 12:20:39] <scrounger> So, they seem to hold some numbers to be more important: numbers that are prime backwards AND forwards
[2013-01-07 12:20:48] <brotherBox> We established that already I think
[2013-01-07 12:20:56] <brotherBox> With the pause after 1033 in the boot sequence

[2013-01-07 12:22:18] <artea> cicadas IIRC evolved to only spawn on prime numbers
[2013-01-07 12:22:25] <AlooGobi> o
[2013-01-07 12:22:26] <fffgg> and both 31 and 71 are prime as well
[2013-01-07 12:22:27] <artea> because they are less likely to spawn with eachother

[2013-01-07 12:30:51] <Cicada> what do yo want explained about it scrounger?
[2013-01-07 12:31:00] <Cosmo_> Crowley was into a lot of shit, but weirdly with everything I've learnt from all of this, he's come up so many times
[2013-01-07 12:31:02] <soulseekah> so summing up about the shell, we figured out the hello message that leads us to another onion, where we wait
[2013-01-07 12:31:13] <soulseekah> the shell also calculates factors
[2013-01-07 12:31:17] <soulseekah> and reverse factors
[2013-01-07 12:31:27] <soulseekah> and also sums up the runes

[2013-01-07 12:31:41] <scrounger> well.. cicada seems to take it very seriously. Crowley gave a command to find an "order and a value" and apparently cicada did that. then everything starts adding up and crazy shit starts fucking priming it up bigtime.

[2013-01-07 12:41:34] <Lurker69> what is causing the change? there is nothing in the code...  
[2013-01-07 12:41:40] <chimp> maybe its the count donw

[2013-01-07 12:56:21] <Absence_> I believe, and I didn't send this to brother becuase I'm not entirely sure, but I think the image Ymgve found was also singed with a PGP signature giving us the link.
[2013-01-07 12:56:34] <iIIustrious> you get a signed message with a tonne of whitespace

[2013-01-07 12:57:13] <Cosmo_> Yeah the spaces and tabs were used to find the onion link i think.
[2013-01-07 12:57:28] <iIIustrious> I can pastebin that message if you want

[2013-01-07 12:58:28] <brotherBox> Ymgve and n_factor don't respond at the moment, which is great.
[2013-01-07 12:58:58] <soulseekah> the tweets are redundant, tweeting out a piece of data that we (or at least Ymgve) already hold
[2013-01-07 12:59:19] <Cicada> i guess they didn't expect that one.
[2013-01-07 12:59:23] <anonalaala> hey anyone on the telnet have you put in the sentences from the original poem about the law book?
[2013-01-07 12:59:29] <anonalaala> is that relevant at all?
[2013-01-07 12:59:43] <chimp> the spaces and tabs were binary ascii or something werent they

[2013-01-07 12:59:53] <Cosmo_> chapter 2 line 55 if memory serves.
[2013-01-07 13:00:07] <chimp> i suggested that at the time

[2013-01-07 13:00:27] <soulseekah> anyone wanna find those in the books mentioned above?
[2013-01-07 13:00:28] <Absence_> could someone get the amount of tweets that need sent out and multiply them by 4 so we can get an exact time on how long we need to wait?

[2013-01-07 13:04:00] <soulseekah> Absence_, for now nothing I think, except the black PNG
[2013-01-07 13:04:09] <Cicada> You think twitter will keep going for another 2 days before we get a clue
[2013-01-07 13:04:09] <Absence_> Mk.
[2013-01-07 13:04:12] <brotherBox> I was disconnected, and this keeps happening.
[2013-01-07 13:04:21] <soulseekah> Cicada, it's tweeting something redundant, something that we already have
[2013-01-07 13:04:26] <n_factor> where did the data come from to xor with the song to get testout.jpg?
[2013-01-07 13:04:29] <soulseekah> probably just pointing it us towards it
[2013-01-07 13:04:29] <onon> join teh clahp brother
[2013-01-07 13:04:35] <Absence_> How do i get the chanserv to recognize its me? I don't usually do IRCs; atleast not in over a year.
[2013-01-07 13:04:37] <brotherBox> >clahp
[2013-01-07 13:04:38] <soulseekah> Ymgve, figured out what it was that it was tweeting
[2013-01-07 13:04:47] <soulseekah> before it finished
[2013-01-07 13:04:49] <Cicada> yes, you think once it is completed, w ewill be able to move on?
[2013-01-07 13:04:52] <n_factor> how?
[2013-01-07 13:04:54] <Cicada> a final messge that we cannot decode now
[2013-01-07 13:05:00] <Cicada> or the onion page will become active
[2013-01-07 13:05:04] <Absence_> soulseekah im going to send u a query

[2013-01-07 13:05:22] <soulseekah> already running late, so talk soon
[2013-01-07 13:06:12] <n_factor> thats my question
[2013-01-07 13:06:13] <soulseekah> probably a file off the the Tiny Linux iso filesystem (3301.img in BOOT)
[2013-01-07 13:06:20] <soulseekah> or one of the DATA files
[2013-01-07 13:06:24] <soulseekah> not sure which one yet
[2013-01-07 13:06:25] <n_factor> how did Ymgve get the full tweet defore it finished
[2013-01-07 13:06:29] <brotherBox> ^
[2013-01-07 13:06:35] <brotherBox> He doesn't respond atm.
[2013-01-07 13:06:42] <Absence_> i believe he did something with 3301
[2013-01-07 13:06:45] <Absence_> the number
[2013-01-07 13:06:46] <n_factor> i xored all the DATA files with the song
[2013-01-07 13:06:50] <Absence_> wasnt here for that part
[2013-01-07 13:06:59] <soulseekah> n_factor, probably a file on the filesystem itself
[2013-01-07 13:07:04] <soulseekah> like the .sh file that generated primes
[2013-01-07 13:07:11] <soulseekah> or rather echoed them out with delays
[2013-01-07 13:07:13] <brotherBox> Guys, just edit the wiki.

[2013-01-07 13:07:31] <soulseekah> it probably had more files, one of which is being tweeted out
[2013-01-07 13:07:50] <soulseekah> Ymgve recognized it before it fininshed, it seems

[2013-01-07 13:08:03] <soulseekah> can only guess, but 47k dumped so far is not enough
[2013-01-07 13:08:18] <soulseekah> where did he get the rest 100k from

[2013-01-07 13:08:40] <n_factor> nope, its not on the iso.
[2013-01-07 13:08:55] <n_factor> the data needed to xor with the song is not on the disk in plaintext
[2013-01-07 13:09:32] <n_factor> i xor'd all the data files and song together in every permiation
[2013-01-07 13:09:36] <n_factor> didnt get the data

[2013-01-07 13:10:25] <Cosmo_> I swear he wrote something himself. n_factor you were here too.
[2013-01-07 13:10:50] <Cosmo_> He said something about it coming in 2 halves, but the second half being redundant

[2013-01-07 13:32:58] <Grazza> see if it makes sense

[2013-01-07 13:35:45] <Lurker69> all we use was outguess, xorin and telneting to onion
[2013-01-07 13:36:05] <iIIustrious> and they've sort of given us a way to convert them to number
[2013-01-07 13:36:30] <Cosmo_> It only came from comparisons earlier. Just after the image was given
[2013-01-07 13:36:52] <iIIustrious> well, I can't get the damn xor to work. I suspect my code is bad, as it's thrown together at 540 am. If no one has a better xor suggestion, I'm going to go crash

[2013-01-07 13:47:43] <n_factor>  but besause  there is repeating 330133013301 after BASE64 ymgve was able to calculate all the tweets out of that "equation":
[2013-01-07 13:47:46] <n_factor> i dont get it
[2013-01-07 13:48:00] <iIIustrious> me neither, yet
[2013-01-07 13:48:08] <iIIustrious> I think there's something missing there
[2013-01-07 13:48:22] <NikTitanik> guys, i noticed something strange

[2013-01-07 13:48:37] <iIIustrious> one of which was repeating 3301's
[2013-01-07 13:48:57] <brotherBox> qwebirc47775, check the topic.
[2013-01-07 13:49:03] <iIIustrious> I haven't got my head around how to make real info out of that

[2013-01-07 13:57:51] <chimp> thanks
[2013-01-07 13:58:20] <crash_demons> do you know of any servers that run a tor proxy to allow users who don't want to run tor to access tor servers? (completely possible to set up)
[2013-01-07 13:58:49] <brotherBox> There is something like that for websites/hidden services
[2013-01-07 13:58:55] <fffgg> so now we're just stuck with Hash: SHA1
[2013-01-07 13:59:01] <brotherBox> Let me check

[2013-01-07 14:00:02] <crash_demons> I would run tor, but the startup sequence is kind of bandwidth-heavy
[2013-01-07 14:00:40] <n_factor> since 761.mp3 XOR 560.13 XOR twitter = base64.cicada.png + "33013301...3301"
[2013-01-07 14:01:19] <n_factor> you can just add the 3301's to the end of base64.cicada.png to the length of the longest file of the other 3
[2013-01-07 14:01:46] <Grazza> WOW
[2013-01-07 14:01:48] <n_factor> then do base64.cicada.png XOR 560.13 XOR 761.mp3 = twitter
[2013-01-07 14:01:51] <Grazza> that makes so much more sense
[2013-01-07 14:01:51] <n_factor> to get the final jpg
[2013-01-07 14:01:51] <Grazza> lol
[2013-01-07 14:02:17] <crash_demons> lol @ web browsers are useless here
[2013-01-07 14:03:50] <brotherBox> Okay, quick question
[2013-01-07 14:04:05] <brotherBox> Does anyone know the original text from the whitespace message?
[2013-01-07 14:04:13] <brotherBox> Was it just that hidden service domain?

[2013-01-07 14:06:16] <chimp> fair enough
[2013-01-07 14:06:22] <brotherBox> Because things can get VERY hectic when something new is discovered and the redundancy increases again

[2013-01-07 14:45:20] <Lurker69> dammit
[2013-01-07 14:45:25] <lull> well try with proxys?
[2013-01-07 14:45:36] <lull> or just post it some where
[2013-01-07 14:45:44] <Lurker69> or they will observe if TO MANY PEOPLE will visit it!!!!!!
[2013-01-07 14:45:53] <lull> hmm true
[2013-01-07 14:45:57] <Lurker69> what to do
[2013-01-07 14:46:09] <lull> guys
[2013-01-07 14:46:17] <lull> we should lock this information
[2013-01-07 14:46:30] <lull> so we dont give another ppl head start
[2013-01-07 14:46:38] <lull> few will make it
[2013-01-07 14:46:53] <Lurker69> ok i will make it so that everybody can solve last bit to get last page...
[2013-01-07 14:47:10] <Lurker69> but all the screngrabs hve adress in them
[2013-01-07 14:47:55] <Lurker69> well all the poeple that were contibuting or just trying to be helpfull until now deserves it
[2013-01-07 14:48:19] <Lurker69> i will make it not so obvious

[2013-01-07 14:56:11] <crash_demons> any way to do this on WinSCP?
[2013-01-07 14:56:16] <crash_demons> I got tor running
[2013-01-07 14:56:49] <crash_demons> I have a Socks4 proxy set in WinSCP, set to telnet, but nomatter what I do it just spits out "host does not exist"

[2013-01-07 15:03:13] <crash_demons> 23 returns '2 2 2 2 2'
[2013-01-07 15:03:17] <NikTitanik> yes
[2013-01-07 15:03:20] <NikTitanik> it factorizes
[2013-01-07 15:03:37] <crash_demons> 2^5 is not 23.
[2013-01-07 15:03:46] <NikTitanik> dont know then
[2013-01-07 15:03:48] <crash_demons> 2*2*2*2*2 = 32
[2013-01-07 15:04:09] <crash_demons> which also returns five 2's
[2013-01-07 15:04:11] <n_factor> its backwards

[2013-01-07 15:14:59] <crash_demons> count eo = 41+
[2013-01-07 15:15:12] <Atlas_> + is always prime

[2013-01-07 15:15:33] <NikTitanik> guys
[2013-01-07 15:15:36] <NikTitanik> the count
[2013-01-07 15:15:37] <crash_demons> lol, the factorizer on the telnet is broken though.
[2013-01-07 15:15:38] <Atlas_> crash, the values you are getting are the same as in the picture, then.
[2013-01-07 15:15:41] <Atlas_> http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/uncovering-cicada/images/1/1a/Testout.jpg
[2013-01-07 15:15:53] <NikTitanik> if you count a single letter it outputs the value in the table with runes
[2013-01-07 15:15:56] <crash_demons> enter '61', returns '2 2 2 2'
[2013-01-07 15:16:09] <NikTitanik> count j
[2013-01-07 15:16:16] <Atlas_> 37
[2013-01-07 15:16:17] <Atlas_> +

[2013-01-07 15:16:34] <n_factor> 16 is 2 2 2 2
[2013-01-07 15:16:43] <n_factor> it reads them backwards too
[2013-01-07 15:16:46] <n_factor> 61 is prime
[2013-01-07 15:16:55] <n_factor> so it assumes you put it in backwards
[2013-01-07 15:17:18] <n_factor> its really there to search for primes that are prime both forward and backward
[2013-01-07 15:17:21] <crash_demons> so only palindromic primes are +'s ?
[2013-01-07 15:17:39] <crash_demons> this is really convoluted.
[2013-01-07 15:17:41] <n_factor> ones that are prime both directions, not necessarily palindromic
[2013-01-07 15:17:50] <crash_demons> well, that's what I meant
[2013-01-07 15:17:56] <indigo_> Anyone consider the + are 1 and the others are 0, as in bianary
[2013-01-07 15:17:57] <crash_demons> just couldn't think of a better term
[2013-01-07 15:18:16] <Cosmo_> So what happens if you put in a sequence of numbers in place of letters and try words? like cicada? 13 31 13 97 89 97
[2013-01-07 15:18:32] <crash_demons> unlisted command: primes
[2013-01-07 15:18:59] <dafga> one thing, cicada returns a + and the count for that is not a prime
[2013-01-07 15:19:20] <crash_demons> "primes" seems to output a table of primes or some junk

[2013-01-07 15:24:52] <crash_demons> of?
[2013-01-07 15:25:30] <crash_demons> decimal value of * is 42.
[2013-01-07 15:25:32] <Cosmo_> What if they're literally to just highlight certan letters?
[2013-01-07 15:25:37] <indigo_> + is 1, * is 0, find the value of those and convert them to base 10, I haven't looked at the telenet, so maybe be therorizing is a bit null, but otherwise give it a try
[2013-01-07 15:25:37] <Cosmo_> *certain
[2013-01-07 15:26:06] <crash_demons> you want to append that bit to the end of the number it returns?

[2013-01-07 15:37:52] <NikTitanik> dont think so
[2013-01-07 15:37:53] <crash_demons> where did this other onion address come from?   xsxnaksict6egxkq.onion
[2013-01-07 15:37:56] <rb9269> FUCK YEAH
[2013-01-07 15:37:59] <rb9269> count s and count z

[2013-01-07 15:38:26] <rb9269> which is what they are assigned in the anglo saxon list
[2013-01-07 15:38:43] <Atlas_> the second onion comes from outguessing the full picture that's still being tweeted
[2013-01-07 15:38:51] <Cooper_> So many computers, so little outlets...
[2013-01-07 15:39:33] <Atlas_> No wait, someone found it by telnetting the first onion, I think.   My bad.
[2013-01-07 15:40:16] <Atlas_> nc -x localhost:48643 emiwp4muu2ktwknf.onion 80
[2013-01-07 15:42:08] <dafga> niktitanik: server is hosted in japan, owned by kddi corp if you didn't already whois it. how did you find it? do you have the telnet server?
[2013-01-07 15:42:25] <NikTitanik> i telneted the second onion link
[2013-01-07 15:42:29] <NikTitanik> entered rubbish
[2013-01-07 15:42:34] <NikTitanik> and on the end was this address
[2013-01-07 15:42:40] <NikTitanik> i whois traced it
[2013-01-07 15:42:58] <NikTitanik> and i got  some more info i dodnt find relevant
[2013-01-07 15:42:59] <NikTitanik> one sec
[2013-01-07 15:43:14] <crash_demons> if you enter extremely large amounts of text to "count" command, it won't put a + or * on the end of the result at all.
[2013-01-07 15:44:11] <Cooper_> FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU
[2013-01-07 15:44:20] <crash_demons> ?
[2013-01-07 15:44:34] <Cooper_> Perfect time for my laptop to decide it isn't running a genuine copy of windows.

[2013-01-07 15:44:52] <Cooper_> Of course, my laptop is the only one of my computers that actually IS running genuine windows.
[2013-01-07 15:44:59] <Cooper_> This is why I pirate.
[2013-01-07 15:45:12] <NikTitanik> http://dawhois.com/traceroute/?query=106.186.17.4 here is the trace route. the first ip is in the us. could that ip be the cicada guy who uploaded the site?
[2013-01-07 15:45:20] <crash_demons> did you just install some updates by chance?
[2013-01-07 15:45:57] <crash_demons> I only had something like that happen *once* and after I rebooted it never happened again... was weird bro
[2013-01-07 15:46:28] <dafga> no thats not how tracert works.
[2013-01-07 15:46:45] <NikTitanik> well i dont really know how it works, it was just an assumption
[2013-01-07 15:47:23] <gman__> what's on the tor sites?
[2013-01-07 15:47:34] <rb9269> crash demons,
[2013-01-07 15:47:34] <rb9269> this is because its looking for primes i think
[2013-01-07 15:47:36] <Cooper_> No. Didn't install an update.
[2013-01-07 15:47:47] <dafga> but it could be owned by him, or a hacked account. still it feels like a mistake on his part if one is going to make people jump through tor. i would think being anon is important.
[2013-01-07 15:47:50] <crash_demons> rb9269, "this" ?
[2013-01-07 15:48:04] <Cooper_> Completely wiped the drive and reinstalled vista (which was the OS it came with)
[2013-01-07 15:48:17] <Cooper_> I'm thinking I might just wipe it again and install 7.

[2013-01-07 15:48:56] <rb9269> the + is for prime numbers i think

[2013-01-07 16:20:34] <Atlas_> Patience.
[2013-01-07 16:20:36] <NikTitanik> a countdown to nothing
[2013-01-07 16:20:46] <NikTitanik> maybe when its over the second onion link will change
[2013-01-07 16:20:57] <Atlas_> That's my best guess, too
[2013-01-07 16:20:58] <gentoomen> Hopefully
[2013-01-07 16:21:09] <Grazza> that makes sense
[2013-01-07 16:21:14] <NikTitanik> and we will get the germanic symbols
[2013-01-07 16:21:23] <NikTitanik> we will have to decypher them and enter the key
[2013-01-07 16:21:54] <NikTitanik> i still dont udnerstand how we already have the image with the germanic symbols if the dumo sint finished

[2013-01-07 16:22:26] <Lurker69> crash_demons	wonders how they figured out that The Instar Emergence would be a front-back prime    ?
[2013-01-07 16:22:30] <Cooper_> xor*
[2013-01-07 16:22:42] <NikTitanik> ok
[2013-01-07 16:22:50] <Cooper_> I think that's how they did it at least.
[2013-01-07 16:23:35] <crash_demons> Lurker69, it seems like a difficult think to do. choose the name that happens to be prime both ways... or maybe they made up tons of names and found a working one? but this one is the best name?
[2013-01-07 16:23:42] <crash_demons> *thing
[2013-01-07 16:23:54] <Atlas_> That's way too random, don't you think?
[2013-01-07 16:24:00] <Lurker69> crash_demons: wasnt folowing, hoe is the name prime?
[2013-01-07 16:24:01] <Grazza> yeah
[2013-01-07 16:24:06] <Lurker69> using telnet?
[2013-01-07 16:24:21] <Grazza> using the runes
[2013-01-07 16:24:33] <Grazza> converting each letter to numbers
[2013-01-07 16:24:42] <crash_demons> Lurker69, translated into values based on the table (or using "count") then added together, results in 761
[2013-01-07 16:24:52] <crash_demons> which is a front-back-prime
[2013-01-07 16:25:07] <Lurker69> they select the name then they  create table so that  you get the prim e aout of it
[2013-01-07 16:25:14] <Grazza> crash, do you know roughly how many front-back primes there are?
[2013-01-07 16:25:30] <crash_demons> I have no idea, really as to the saturation
[2013-01-07 16:25:38] <lull> We must shed our own circumferences; Find the divinity within and emerge. guys, any1 thought this might give us more? anagram?

[2013-01-07 16:26:21] <crash_demons> Grazza, are you really asking, or was that rhetorical?
[2013-01-07 16:27:08] * crash_demons thinks this ARG would be a whole lot cooler if it started making vague reference to Wormwood as the Instar
[2013-01-07 16:27:19] <crash_demons> more doomsaying
[2013-01-07 16:27:32] <anonalaala_> we did think about anagrams but.... there's no anagram decypher on the net that can handle that many characters

[2013-01-07 16:32:42] <anonalaala_> Lurker69: for the record I think they realized with this code that was a palindromic prime first, and then shaped things around that.  Not the other way around
[2013-01-07 16:33:19] <crash_demons> palindromic primes are different things. I made that mistake earlier.

[2013-01-07 16:35:10] <Cooper_> And the file sizes.

[2013-01-07 17:06:28] <fffgg> I can't suppress the thought that some people have already figured it out and have left and are keeping quiet because they have been told to do so
[2013-01-07 17:06:46] <fffgg> [/paranoia]
[2013-01-07 17:07:40] <crash_demons> would they *all* keep quiet?
[2013-01-07 17:08:31] <fffgg> they would, I saw that last year there was a message telling you to keep some things for yourself, and if you didn't you'd be out of the game
[2013-01-07 17:08:40] <gentoomen> They probably believe that anyone who is worthy of joining would be able to figure it out.
[2013-01-07 17:08:43] <fffgg> at least, I would :p
[2013-01-07 17:08:47] <gentoomen> And yeah what fffgg said.
[2013-01-07 17:08:58] <rb9269> crash_demons, how far did you guys get in the forward backward primes thing?
[2013-01-07 17:09:16] <Tech1> I hate to ask the obvious, but no one actually knows what cicada is right? or did i miss that somewhere along the way?
[2013-01-07 17:09:31] <fffgg> I'm only disappointed because I know nothing of tor, xor, telnet and whatever so all action I am getting is in this IRC
[2013-01-07 17:09:35] <crash_demons> rb9269, I'm convince that's that the * is for. there's not much information to squeeze from that though
[2013-01-07 17:10:09] <Cooper_> ver
[2013-01-07 17:10:16] <rb9269> are you sure? i ran the numbers from the rune list through and most of them come up as +, but not all
[2013-01-07 17:10:21] <Cooper_> "the command you typed"
[2013-01-07 17:10:26] <Cooper_> "does not seem to exist"
[2013-01-07 17:10:31] <Cooper_> "but countless more do"
[2013-01-07 17:10:48] <fffgg> countless as in: infinite?
[2013-01-07 17:10:49] <gentoomen> fffgg, just look at the wiki page for tor, for xor take a free online standford crypto course, telnet is just an older insecure version of SSH
[2013-01-07 17:10:52] <crash_demons> invalid commands produce one of several random messages.
[2013-01-07 17:11:08] <crash_demons> fffgg, well, since numbers are valid commands - yes. lol
[2013-01-07 17:11:25] <rb9269> 19, 23, 29,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,83,89,103 and 109 all give you back numbers even though they're primes
[2013-01-07 17:11:51] <crash_demons> rb9269, how about 91, 32, 92, 14 ... ?
[2013-01-07 17:12:11] <crash_demons> the number command checks forwards and backwards.
[2013-01-07 17:12:26] <fffgg> so these are indeed the non-reversible primes
[2013-01-07 17:12:27] <daemos> whats does 'HASH:SHA1' mean?
[2013-01-07 17:12:49] <NikTitanik> it says countless more do, which means infinite, there is an infinite amount of numbers. numbers are functions
[2013-01-07 17:12:52] <rb9269> its reversing the numbers
[2013-01-07 17:12:56] <lulzorz> gentoomen: telnet as a login protocol really isn't relevant here, we're interested in it letting you talk straight to a socket
[2013-01-07 17:12:56] <Tech1> it's a one way hash algorithm (spelling)
[2013-01-07 17:13:07] <rb9269> 91 give the same answer as 19
[2013-01-07 17:13:19] <crash_demons> rb9269, it checks both forwards and backwards.  I don't need to say it again :po
[2013-01-07 17:14:28] <lull> patientia est virtus, what if the find the divinity within means we have to find vitues? there are the seven "divine virtues"
[2013-01-07 17:14:33] <gentoomen> Ah okay, i'm looking up netcat now.

[2013-01-07 17:15:10] <rb9269> :)
[2013-01-07 17:15:33] <lulzorz> gentoomen: you'd be better off using telnet for this, IMO...it lets you know when you're connected, which is important for high-latency networks
[2013-01-07 17:15:53] <daemos> what are we doing now?
[2013-01-07 17:15:55] <lull> Chastity, Temperance, Charity, Diligence, Patience, Kindness, Humility
[2013-01-07 17:16:36] <chimp> it does say patience is a virtue
[2013-01-07 17:16:39] <chimp> maybe its just referencing that
[2013-01-07 17:16:45] <lulzorz> daemos: it's a PGP thing
[2013-01-07 17:16:49] <lull>      Valour: Pursuit of Knowledge     Generosity: Pursuit of Charity     Liberality: Pursuit of Will     Diligence: Pursuit of Ethics     Patience: Pursuit of Peace     Kindness: Pursuit of Love     Humility: Pursuit of Modesty
[2013-01-07 17:16:56] <chimp> we have to find virtues, i.e. find the page that says patience is a virtue
[2013-01-07 17:17:30] <lulzorz> or you could just read the page
[2013-01-07 17:17:32] <daemos> maybe he ment the twitter since he would have to wait for all the tweets
[2013-01-07 17:17:37] <lulzorz> and see where it says
[2013-01-07 17:17:39] <lull> guys guys
[2013-01-07 17:17:50] <lulzorz> "which means, come back soon."
[2013-01-07 17:18:08] <lull> this might be something Root - Patience/Wrath which is one the seven chakras
[2013-01-07 17:18:12] <fffgg> daemos; to answer your question about where we are: we are in the random-guessing-part
[2013-01-07 17:18:29] <chimp> lulzors, thats what i meant
[2013-01-07 17:18:46] <chimp> could just be a sly reference to that page and not some deeper riddle

[2013-01-07 17:22:09] <Tech1> yeah, but NikTitanik we are anxious exploratory nerds.  pretty sure they'd give us something to chew on.
[2013-01-07 17:22:12] <daemos> how do you ping an onion server?
[2013-01-07 17:22:12] <chimp> im still trying to work out how they got the second onion url from the first one
[2013-01-07 17:22:30] <Tech1> daemos: you on linux?
[2013-01-07 17:22:54] <soulseekah> chimp, you type hello at the 1st onion prompt
[2013-01-07 17:23:05] <soulseekah> you get a hexdump of plain ascii message with the 2nd onion
[2013-01-07 17:23:06] <chimp> yeah and you get that big load of numbers and text
[2013-01-07 17:23:14] <chimp> oh right
[2013-01-07 17:23:19] <soulseekah> Yes it says, well done, now go to...
[2013-01-07 17:23:39] <Lurker69> lol, test if you are  too much in crypto:    put x in your browser; if you found http://home.paulschou.net/tools/xlate/ among seggestions you should.....
[2013-01-07 17:23:42] <chimp> yeah i have the second one
[2013-01-07 17:23:53] <soulseekah> so any changes since those 2 were discovered, 2nd one still says about patience?
[2013-01-07 17:23:56] <Cooper_> Maybe the numbers of the virtues are port numbers?
[2013-01-07 17:24:13] <Tech1> Cooper_: only ports i found open on the 2nd onion were 80 and 81
[2013-01-07 17:24:18] <daemos> lurker i got xkcd and /x/
[2013-01-07 17:24:28] <lull> patience is the 5th
[2013-01-07 17:24:54] <daemos> i only know of one onion

[2013-01-07 17:25:12] <Tech1> i didn't scan crazy high for obvious reasons, xsx*.onion? that one?
[2013-01-07 17:25:40] <Cooper_> Maybe the first onion is relevant?
[2013-01-07 17:26:14] <daemos> is the first the one saying 'web browsers dont work here'?
[2013-01-07 17:26:29] <Cooper_> Yes.
[2013-01-07 17:26:33] <daemos> ok]
[2013-01-07 17:26:34] <soulseekah> connect to it via netcat
[2013-01-07 17:26:36] <Cooper_> We should try both just to be sure.
[2013-01-07 17:26:39] <soulseekah> and you get a prompt
[2013-01-07 17:26:43] <daemos> can i have link to second?
[2013-01-07 17:26:49] <soulseekah> which gives you all sorts of things
[2013-01-07 17:27:00] <soulseekah> for one it calculates factors for palindromes
[2013-01-07 17:27:07] <soulseekah> for two it calculates rune sums
[2013-01-07 17:27:15] <lull> does the numbers 4 17 1994 mean anything?
[2013-01-07 17:27:16] <soulseekah> and for three it gives us the 2nd onion
[2013-01-07 17:27:23] <gentoomen> I can't seem to telnet the second one... Is there something special i'm meant to be doing?
[2013-01-07 17:27:50] <soulseekah> gentoomen, simple nc -x localhost:tor ......onion 80

[2013-01-07 17:36:50] * primius would like to point out that the space/tab code is backwards of last year's, so old scripts will need to be inverted
[2013-01-07 17:36:58] <soulseekah> lull, sweet
[2013-01-07 17:37:02] <Lurker69> Cooper_: and left last line out, so PGP doesnt compile correctly
[2013-01-07 17:37:15] <Lesmo> Hello again?
[2013-01-07 17:37:22] <Cooper_> ah
[2013-01-07 17:37:43] <Lurker69> primius: do you remember tab/space code from last year?
[2013-01-07 17:38:01] <Cooper_> Coffee time
[2013-01-07 17:38:17] <primius> Lurker69: I still have all my old scripts
[2013-01-07 17:38:19] <Lurker69> primius: wasnt last year tab/space code on that coyote (helo) pagge that was troll?

[2013-01-07 17:38:31] -->| rb33333 (~rb9269@87.236.135.98) has joined #33012013
[2013-01-07 17:39:13] <primius> Lurker69: actually, the tab/space code that showed all the image filenames (including the ones we never found) was posted on the 8.com, pgp signed, for a few hours
[2013-01-07 17:39:29] <primius> one of the guys in the Wind 3301 group regged 8.tk and mirrored it there
[2013-01-07 17:39:31] <primius> and then forgot about it
[2013-01-07 17:39:48] <daemos> what was the runes picture about anyway?
[2013-01-07 17:39:55] <primius> we doxed the shit out of 8.tk and shat brix when we found who ran it
[2013-01-07 17:40:15] <primius> and then one of us was like, "oh, FUCK, I forgot about that"
[2013-01-07 17:40:25] <Lurker69> primius: did that 8.com page contain this image http://imgur.com/JqXj1 ?
[2013-01-07 17:40:27] <primius> and then we were like, "oooooh, this is going to be fun"
[2013-01-07 17:40:46] <lull> hmm
[2013-01-07 17:40:59] <primius> Lurker69: I can't remember...that might have been the fake onion or i2p site
[2013-01-07 17:41:02] <lull> patience is a virtue. refers to a latin poem
[2013-01-07 17:41:26] <primius> Lurker69: checking my records, yeah, that's what we put on there
[2013-01-07 17:41:36] <Lurker69> primius: ok i had connection between tab/space and ztha timage in ma head but i am not sure what was where
[2013-01-07 17:41:43] <primius> it was scaled really big so I could fit the outguess into it
[2013-01-07 17:41:44] <Cooper_> Go on lull?
[2013-01-07 17:42:09] <primius> anyway, the tab/space code was totally legit, and contained valid 3301 pgp
[2013-01-07 17:42:18] <primius> but everyone except us only ever saw it on our site
[2013-01-07 17:42:22] <crash_demons> Again: the ascii art contains 8 difference characters. Bytes have 8 bits. It is possible the ascii art (removing spacing) contains a message
[2013-01-07 17:42:23] <primius> so 8.tk looked totally legit
[2013-01-07 17:42:23] <Lurker69> primius: one i posted should still have outguess in it then
[2013-01-07 17:42:38] <primius> because where else could the pgp have come from?
[2013-01-07 17:43:05] <Lurker69> primius so i was right 8.tk fake site had coyotee and tab/space code?
[2013-01-07 17:43:13] <daemos> Patience is a virtue  Posess it if you can  Seldom in a woman  but never in a man.
[2013-01-07 17:43:14] <primius> Lurker69: yeah, outguessing it now
[2013-01-07 17:43:21] <lull> cooper_ its called spychomania
[2013-01-07 17:43:29] <lull> psychomania*
[2013-01-07 17:43:35] * crash_demons thinks: annd nobody cares
[2013-01-07 17:43:40] <crash_demons> figures :p
[2013-01-07 17:43:44] <Lurker69> i was afraid that cicada is using same cipher trolls used last year, that would be really really lame
[2013-01-07 17:43:53] <lull> http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/prudentius/prud.psycho.shtml
[2013-01-07 17:44:12] <fffgg> crash demons: sounds cool, but I have no idea how to figure it out
[2013-01-07 17:44:13] <primius> crash_demons: I was getting to your messages :p
[2013-01-07 17:45:12] <primius> Lurker69: actually, all the trolls sort of got together and hung out for a bit after last year's puzzle, and cicada said in their messages that they weren't doing the trolls
[2013-01-07 17:45:19] <daemos> google chome wont translate
[2013-01-07 17:45:23] <daemos> chrome*
[2013-01-07 17:45:36] <primius> Lurker69: so I know pretty much who did what, and no evidence ever led me to suspect that 3301 was putting out any disinfo at all
[2013-01-07 17:45:59] <fffgg> trolls just troll for the trolling
[2013-01-07 17:46:01] <Cooper_> So you were involved last year Primus?
[2013-01-07 17:46:21] <Cooper_> Primius*
[2013-01-07 17:46:24] <primius> Cooper_: yeah, almost made it too
[2013-01-07 17:46:29] <Lurker69> primius: yes outguess stil there... :-) 
[2013-01-07 17:46:40] <_anon_> Was last year the first year?
[2013-01-07 17:46:42] <primius> couldn't get the number factored or got stuck on the midi or something, I forget
[2013-01-07 17:46:47] <Cooper_> Just a few minutes off getting the email through hmm?
[2013-01-07 17:46:59] <crash_demons> one idea is that each different character (+,7:=?I~) is for a bit, and that it reads into bytes going a certain direction ++++ four bytes of '1' (or 0?) +,++ three bytes of 3,11 (or 1,00?)
[2013-01-07 17:47:03] <primius> I was in pretty bad shape by the end of it, hardly slept at all
[2013-01-07 17:47:10] <Cooper_> Factoring shouldn't be an issue this year,
[2013-01-07 17:47:22] <primius> crash_demons: or perhaps it's just an ascii art banner?
[2013-01-07 17:47:36] <Cooper_> If we run it through the one onion, it should factor it for us,
[2013-01-07 17:47:54] <daemos> http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?sl=la&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelatinlibrary.com%2Fprudentius%2Fprud.psycho.shtml&act=url
[2013-01-07 17:47:56] <crash_demons> primius, maybe, but why use such a restrictive set of characters that don't seem to give any image detail?
[2013-01-07 17:48:26] <crash_demons> ie: the characters aren't even placed in a way that makes sense for the image
[2013-01-07 17:48:39] <Lurker69> primius: only shill from cicada last yera i suspect could be wind, all others were players...  wind was only one who didnt get identified ever

[2013-01-07 17:49:44] <primius> Lurker69: yeah, I never paid any attention to wind, don't know a lot about her
[2013-01-07 17:49:57] <primius> as for factoring large numbers with the onion

[2013-01-07 18:14:35] <NikTitanik> the first onion link
[2013-01-07 18:14:36] <lull> hmm my guess is that we solved the twitter faster than they thought and that is why we fisrt saw the 1st onion site only with half of the text and now the patience is a virtue. text is there because its not rdy or put online

[2013-01-07 18:21:23] <Atlas_> Alright thanks.
[2013-01-07 18:22:06] <Cooper_> Someone mentioned the latin poem Psychomachia.
[2013-01-07 18:22:12] <lull> it wa sme
[2013-01-07 18:22:16] <lull> was*

[2013-01-07 18:23:04] <lull> yes i believe
[2013-01-07 18:23:07] <Cooper_> I think out of the seven virtues, charity might have something t do with it.
[2013-01-07 18:23:23] <lull> yeap
[2013-01-07 18:23:43] <Cooper_> When "count charity" is run on the one onion through netcat, it returns a prime number.
[2013-01-07 18:23:52] <Cooper_> None of the others do.
[2013-01-07 18:24:03] <lull> hmm try caritas
[2013-01-07 18:24:30] <lull> or patientia
[2013-01-07 18:24:33] <Cooper_> caritas is not a command
[2013-01-07 18:24:39] <Atlas_> any anagram returns the very same value, right?
[2013-01-07 18:24:42] <Cooper_> and does not return a prime number

[2013-01-07 18:26:10] <lull> wrath*
[2013-01-07 18:26:13] <Cooper_> Wait, the seven virtues are all oposites of the seven sins right?

[2013-01-07 18:28:41] <lull> theyre chakras of charity and patience
[2013-01-07 18:29:06] <Cooper_> I think charity providing the only prime is just coincidence.
[2013-01-07 18:29:13] <Cooper_> We might want to note it in the wiki though.
[2013-01-07 18:29:56] <crash_demons> while we're on it. none of the seven deadly sins is a reversible prime. Pride and Greed are non-reversible ones though
[2013-01-07 18:30:14] <crash_demons> in english
[2013-01-07 18:30:22] <NikTitanik> greed returns 251
[2013-01-07 18:30:27] <NikTitanik> which is also a prime
[2013-01-07 18:30:40] <crash_demons> didnt I say that?
[2013-01-07 18:30:46] <lull> niktitanik try this patientia est virtus
[2013-01-07 18:31:36] <NikTitanik> @crash_demons: didnt see; lull: 831
[2013-01-07 18:32:29] <lull> aint a prime
[2013-01-07 18:32:32] <NikTitanik> nope
[2013-01-07 18:32:57] <Cooper_> Well, I'm out of ideas so I'm going to take a break. Could someone message me if somthing happens so I can return my attention to the chat? I'll be working on some other stuff in the meantime.

[2013-01-07 19:57:39] <brotherBox> Anyone care to update me?
[2013-01-07 19:57:42] <chimp> heh maybe they lost connection
[2013-01-07 19:57:42] <lull> its down again
[2013-01-07 19:57:45] <Tech1> they sure did
[2013-01-07 19:57:50] <daemos> i cant connect to 2nd onion
[2013-01-07 19:57:52] <NikTitanik> they dun goofed
[2013-01-07 19:58:01] <Tech1> down on clearnet as well
[2013-01-07 19:58:02] <brotherBox> ^
[2013-01-07 19:58:07] <gentoomen> brother, how much updating do you need?
[2013-01-07 19:58:10] <lull> cicada acualy is dolan!!!
[2013-01-07 19:58:10] <chimp> brotherbox, where did you leave off
[2013-01-07 19:58:16] * lulzorz doesn't even know what's going on anymore
[2013-01-07 19:58:18] <chimp> lull plz
[2013-01-07 19:58:37] <brotherBox> Second onion, input factorizes numbers
[2013-01-07 19:58:54] <chimp> it doesnt factorize them i dont think, it adds each letter up
[2013-01-07 19:58:57] <chimp> based onits value from the rune table
[2013-01-07 19:58:57] <youdontknow> the twitter either missed one, or has jumped back up to an 8 minute interval, keep an eye on it and see if that stays steady
[2013-01-07 19:59:15] <brotherBox> Oh
[2013-01-07 19:59:18] <lull> 5 4 8?
[2013-01-07 19:59:30] <chimp> and tells you whether its a prime with *
[2013-01-07 19:59:36] <chimp> reveresible prime with *, normal prime with +
[2013-01-07 19:59:40] <chimp> and uh yeah,
[2013-01-07 19:59:46] <brotherBox> Thanks chimp.
[2013-01-07 19:59:49] <chimp> bunch of phrases relevant to all of this are primes
[2013-01-07 19:59:52] <brotherBox> ^
[2013-01-07 19:59:58] <brotherBox> I got that yet.
[2013-01-07 20:00:00] <chimp> ive made a list, add it to wiki maybe?
[2013-01-07 20:00:26] <brotherBox> Do so yourself please, I'm kind of busy.
[2013-01-07 20:00:34] <brotherBox> I'll look over it later, I promise.
[2013-01-07 20:00:43] <lull> ur down with http://li528-4.members.linode.com:81/ still?
[2013-01-07 20:00:59] <Aloogobi> I'll need some updating aswell. Left this morning after the palindrome revelation
[2013-01-07 20:01:04] <Tech1> lull: yeah, still down
[2013-01-07 20:01:05] <lull> look twitter
[2013-01-07 20:01:06] <youdontknow> twitter still at the 4m intervals
[2013-01-07 20:01:11] <lull> it missed one
[2013-01-07 20:01:16] <chimp> the palindrome revelation? i missed that one
[2013-01-07 20:01:26] <Ymgve> hm, the cover art for the mp3 isn't embedded in the file

[2013-01-07 20:01:45] <primius> Ymgve: vlc finds it with google
[2013-01-07 20:01:52] <Aloogobi> they realized that the prime numbers are prime numbers back wards aswell. Or something of the sort
[2013-01-07 20:01:54] <Ymgve> heh
[2013-01-07 20:02:08] <Aloogobi> VLC? I SUGGESTED VLC. I'M NOT USELESS!\
[2013-01-07 20:02:22] <chimp> oh yeah many of hte primes are reversible , two so far are not
[2013-01-07 20:02:26] <chimp> and are denoted with + symbols instead of *
[2013-01-07 20:02:30] <chimp> they are just normal primes or something
[2013-01-07 20:02:35] <chimp> count gematria primus
[2013-01-07 20:02:37] <chimp> 641+
[2013-01-07 20:02:46] <sr01> aloo, this was mentioned yesterday already
[2013-01-07 20:03:05] * primius fakekicks Aloogobi for being a tard
[2013-01-07 20:03:17] <sr01> its cool
[2013-01-07 20:03:28] <chimp> did people have the first onion yesterday? damn im behind
[2013-01-07 20:03:41] <sr01> hm
[2013-01-07 20:03:44] <sr01> i dont remember
[2013-01-07 20:03:53] <sr01> youneedtofinditelswere.onion
[2013-01-07 20:03:53] <brotherBox> Depends on how long ago yesterday is
[2013-01-07 20:03:53] <chimp> when is yesterday for you, ~24 hours?
[2013-01-07 20:03:54] <Aloogobi> The first onion was last night/this morning
[2013-01-07 20:04:06] <brotherBox> 20 for me
[2013-01-07 20:04:12] <chimp> yeah this morning for me i thought, at the start of work it was
[2013-01-07 20:04:14] <brotherBox> They had it about 7 hours ago I think
[2013-01-07 20:04:14] <Aloogobi> ^
[2013-01-07 20:04:16] <crash_demons1> you know what's even more insane about that 973 website?
[2013-01-07 20:04:26] <lull> well?
[2013-01-07 20:04:32] <crash_demons1> they have a forum. :p
[2013-01-07 20:04:36] <chimp> haha

[2013-01-07 20:05:51] <NikTitanik> thats fake afaik
[2013-01-07 20:06:22] <NikTitanik> sr01
[2013-01-07 20:06:22] <soulseekah> that is fake http://pastebin.com/J8AadNf4

[2013-01-07 20:06:23] <brotherBox> Wtf is that site?
[2013-01-07 20:06:23] <sr01> okay
[2013-01-07 20:06:23] <primius> it's not fake, it just wants you to do your own fucking work
[2013-01-07 20:06:23] <NikTitanik> sr01 thats fake, the actual one points to the second onion
[2013-01-07 20:06:23] <chimp> its a direct portal to the mind of alister crowley
[2013-01-07 20:06:23] <crash_demons1> brotherBox, numerologists anonymous
[2013-01-07 20:06:24] <crash_demons1> I guess
[2013-01-07 20:06:37] <primius> and if you're not smart enough to understand that, you're the reason it was redacted in that fasion
[2013-01-07 20:07:12] <sr01> why so personal
[2013-01-07 20:07:33] <brotherBox> ^
[2013-01-07 20:07:37] <soulseekah> primius, I see, I thought it was groupwork
[2013-01-07 20:07:48] <soulseekah> when did this turn into wiping all we have
[2013-01-07 20:07:56] <soulseekah> why the heck are the onions covered up now?
[2013-01-07 20:08:11] <soulseekah> people should be able to go play with the shell
[2013-01-07 20:08:17] <soulseekah> and monitor the 2nd onion
[2013-01-07 20:08:24] <primius> soulseekah: because last year, we flooded them with noobs and they took them down

[2013-01-07 20:09:08] <Diff_> Noobs?
[2013-01-07 20:09:13] <soulseekah> so who gets to see the info?
[2013-01-07 20:09:19] <soulseekah> who chooses? I don't get it
[2013-01-07 20:09:23] <primius> soulseekah: people who solve the puzzles?
[2013-01-07 20:09:32] <primius> if you can't decode tab/space code yourself
[2013-01-07 20:09:34] <primius> you're fucked
[2013-01-07 20:09:36] <Diff_> Fair
[2013-01-07 20:09:51] <Aloogobi> great.... I was just starting to have some fun
[2013-01-07 20:09:58] <primius> posting the way to solve the puzzles is quite enough for most everyone
[2013-01-07 20:10:14] <youdontknow> the twitter jumped to an eight minute interval for one iteration again
[2013-01-07 20:10:17] <chimp> speaking of the shell, can anyone connect to the first onion yet? i still cant
[2013-01-07 20:10:27] <chimp> oh wait never mind
[2013-01-07 20:10:29] <chimp> i can now
[2013-01-07 20:10:32] <primius> it would be even good to teach people how to use the solutions
[2013-01-07 20:10:45] <soulseekah> primius, fair enough
[2013-01-07 20:10:46] <primius> but remember, the people in charge are looking to reduce the number
[2013-01-07 20:11:00] <primius> and eventually, if things happen like they did last year, the puzzles will be individual
[2013-01-07 20:11:11] <chimp> what sucks is that at some point, most of us will be filtered out and will never find out what it was about
[2013-01-07 20:11:15] <chimp> and its going to be a gigantic case of blue balls
[2013-01-07 20:11:17] <primius> at which point, if people have been learning the whole way, they will continue to learn and do fine
[2013-01-07 20:11:24] <lull> twitter went to 848
[2013-01-07 20:11:29] <lull> 8 min 4 min 8 min
[2013-01-07 20:11:32] <primius> but if they've just been coasting through with the answers always handed to them, they'll faceplant
[2013-01-07 20:11:34] <lull> weard
[2013-01-07 20:11:41] <Diff_> At this point I don't care about finishing, I just love learning about all this stuff
[2013-01-07 20:11:52] <soulseekah> http://codeseekah.com/cicada/tweets.html latest tweets with times at the bottom
[2013-01-07 20:11:53] <alkapwn> is the outguessed message from the rune table broken? It's just showing me a blank message on the wiki followed by the pgp sig
[2013-01-07 20:11:58] <Aloogobi> XOR and Mp3 coding is not a one night learning experience
[2013-01-07 20:12:00] <G[k]> For the people who don't make it. This is just a learning experience for next time.
[2013-01-07 20:12:06] <primius> plus, we don't want to ruin things for people...it's more fun to get the answers yourself anyway
[2013-01-07 20:12:23] <primius> </philosophy>
[2013-01-07 20:12:42] <Aloogobi> Lets just see how this boat flows. If the bottle neck approaches, so be it
[2013-01-07 20:12:58] <Tech1> forgot to open that tag primius
[2013-01-07 20:13:11] <soulseekah> again twitter is tweeting redundand data from one of the files in the DATA directory
[2013-01-07 20:13:34] <crash_demons1> if we're not supposed to share information, why does this channel exist?  to accelerate the elite?
[2013-01-07 20:13:39] <primius> soulseekah: well, it's xored, but we know what it is already
[2013-01-07 20:13:55] <soulseekah> primius, yes, just pointing it out to those looking at twitter
[2013-01-07 20:14:06] <soulseekah> it still has around half the data to dump (day or two)
[2013-01-07 20:14:08] <primius> crash_demons1: as I said, in my opinion, sharing the methods so solve things is good
[2013-01-07 20:14:13] <Tech1> crash, i'm here for the ride man.
[2013-01-07 20:14:29] <primius> but just putting the solutions right out there seems unfun to me
[2013-01-07 20:14:42] <Aloogobi> Alright, so what are next steps? I hear the access is non responsve?
[2013-01-07 20:14:48] <lull> http://xsxnaksict6egxkq.onion/
[2013-01-07 20:14:59] <soulseekah> Aloogobi, is it unresponsive? seems to work for me
[2013-01-07 20:15:00] <crash_demons1> derp.
[2013-01-07 20:15:13] <primius> looks down to me
[2013-01-07 20:15:23] <lull> its down
[2013-01-07 20:15:25] <gentoomen> I can't access the second site via the tor browser.
[2013-01-07 20:15:31] <daemos> me either
[2013-01-07 20:15:33] <chimp> i can , reloads fine
[2013-01-07 20:15:39] <soulseekah> my shell is still up, responds
[2013-01-07 20:15:46] <chimp> nothing new on it
[2013-01-07 20:16:01] <lull> weard that only you can connect
[2013-01-07 20:16:12] <chimp> unless its cached or someting
[2013-01-07 20:16:14] <primius> fucking tor, you can't explain it
[2013-01-07 20:16:16] <chimp> does tor browser cache shit?
[2013-01-07 20:16:20] <daemos> soulseekah is cicada

[2013-01-07 20:19:01] <chimp> typing quit makes you quit
[2013-01-07 20:19:03] <chimp> i just found that out
[2013-01-07 20:19:06] <Aloogobi> I'm at a school computer, what's do you see at this connection? What are these links? I know you have to connect to them using netcap or whatnot...
[2013-01-07 20:19:12] <soulseekah> NikTitanik, nice find
[2013-01-07 20:19:13] <chimp> thought it might be an obvious hiding in plain sight think

[2013-01-07 20:19:26] <chimp> yeah i know i know
[2013-01-07 20:19:29] <chimp> had to test it

[2013-01-07 20:19:34] <chimp> :p
[2013-01-07 20:19:39] <NikTitanik> @soulseekah was that sarcasm?

[2013-01-07 20:22:06] <chimp> yeah "the command you typed, does not exist, but others do" is very poetical

[2013-01-07 20:22:37] <soulseekah> lulzorz, that's what I thought, but then I started getting another response for the same command after 10-15 tries

[2013-01-07 20:29:20] <Cooper_> possible to buffer overflow then?

[2013-01-07 21:01:33] <Tech1> nik, i'll be honest, i think you may be wasting time. pretty sure we're just at the point of waiting for the twitter feed to expire; then the next clue will be revealed.

[2013-01-07 21:01:37] <soulseekah> I think the song was made use of already

[2013-01-07 21:02:08] <indigo_> I feel like we haven't found anything in the music part of the song, It would suprise me if there was nothing there

[2013-01-07 21:56:26] <soulseekah> if all get/post made it post that
[2013-01-07 21:56:35] <soulseekah> then it may have been intentional
[2013-01-07 21:56:37] <Tech1> damn you short term memory!
[2013-01-07 21:56:59] <soulseekah> and the fact that it went down is actually what we've been waiting for
[2013-01-07 21:56:59] <Absence_> Question: has anyone OutGuessed the black image?
[2013-01-07 21:56:59] <chimp> why would they intentionally reveal it tohugh
[2013-01-07 21:57:01] <chimp> though*
[2013-01-07 21:57:04] <soulseekah> we move away from tor to linode and continue
[2013-01-07 21:57:13] <Absence_> Also; the response to 'hello' has it changed?
[2013-01-07 21:57:19] <Absence_> Maybe they changed urls.
[2013-01-07 21:57:27] <soulseekah> the onion stays the same though
[2013-01-07 21:57:35] <soulseekah> it's generated from the public key last time I checked
[2013-01-07 21:57:41] <--| Mortvert has left #33012013
[2013-01-07 21:57:41] <soulseekah> if they've changed server then yes
[2013-01-07 21:57:45] <soulseekah> the onion would have to change
[2013-01-07 21:57:52] <soulseekah> meanine the 1st onion would have to give us a new onion
[2013-01-07 21:58:07] <Tech1> but soul, the puppetmasters would have to backtrack if that was the case; removing the 2nd onion from play.
[2013-01-07 21:58:10] <soulseekah> as a possiblity
[2013-01-07 21:58:19] <soulseekah> the 2nd onion is down at the moment
[2013-01-07 21:58:28] <Tech1> so i'd expect an update at the 1st onion, if that is their play
[2013-01-07 21:58:30] <soulseekah> so it's considered to be "removed"
[2013-01-07 21:58:39] <soulseekah> they're working on it :D
[2013-01-07 21:58:42] <Absence_> They did say "Patience is a virtue."
[2013-01-07 21:58:50] <soulseekah> move server, update distrib, compile apache
[2013-01-07 21:58:51] <Absence_> Maybe they took it down till the twitter is down?
[2013-01-07 21:58:52] <Tech1> it's the only data, apart from the twitter, then can put info out to the 'masses' via.
[2013-01-07 21:58:53] <Absence_> done*
[2013-01-07 21:58:54] <soulseekah> takes time :)
[2013-01-07 21:58:57] <soulseekah> just a crazy theory
[2013-01-07 21:59:01] <NikTitanik> the hallo message is the same
[2013-01-07 21:59:10] <soulseekah> trying to think of why it may have been intentional, vs. not intentional
[2013-01-07 21:59:16] <soulseekah> yes it is
[2013-01-07 21:59:20] <Tech1> i agree soul, i think the next message is from one of the two onions.

[2013-01-07 22:00:18] <Absence_> Ugh; I need to get VMware
[2013-01-07 22:00:19] <soulseekah> so several fronts to work on: black-cicada outline PNG, hidden comands in 1st onion, what else?
[2013-01-07 22:00:35] <NikTitanik> chich png are you talking about?
[2013-01-07 22:00:37] <Tech1> they HAD to have realized someone would try and grab headers. and i'm sure this 'game' was put through numerous checks before it went live. they would or at least <i> should </i> have caught it
[2013-01-07 22:00:40] <soulseekah> the mp3, the splash from the BOOT
[2013-01-07 22:00:42] <JackHinds> do you need linux to find the hidden commands in the 1st onion?
[2013-01-07 22:00:58] <soulseekah> Tech1, well funny thing is that I did grab the headers first thing
[2013-01-07 22:01:05] <soulseekah> and there were no errors
[2013-01-07 22:01:09] <Absence_> I need someone to outguess the Black PNG that no one has found a use for.
[2013-01-07 22:01:16] <soulseekah> although I grabbed them when index.html was live
[2013-01-07 22:01:17] <lulzorz> you know, last year, we perturbed an onion into giving its hostname out, and it was "cicada"
[2013-01-07 22:01:25] <lulzorz> why did they do things less securely this year?

[2013-01-07 22:02:16] <NikTitanik> ok
[2013-01-07 22:02:59] <soulseekah> yes, the one with the silver outline
[2013-01-07 22:03:07] <Absence_> Could someone try to ping the IP of the 2nd onion?
[2013-01-07 22:03:14] <soulseekah> Absence_, it's up
[2013-01-07 22:03:20] <soulseekah> the plain linode IP

[2013-01-07 22:04:02] <Absence_> Could someone try to connect through it via command line? Linux of course.
[2013-01-07 22:04:04] <soulseekah> 10 minutes ago I could pign it no problem
[2013-01-07 22:04:08] <Absence_> And give me the error?
[2013-01-07 22:04:20] <soulseekah> Absence_, not responding of course
[2013-01-07 22:04:26] <soulseekah> socket timeout and stuff
[2013-01-07 22:04:40] <Absence_> Is it giving a code or just not responding?
[2013-01-07 22:04:53] <soulseekah> standard stuff, no meaning
[2013-01-07 22:04:54] <Absence_> Can you check the DNS records and see how fresh it is?
[2013-01-07 22:04:55] <soulseekah> host is down
[2013-01-07 22:05:08] <Absence_> Its not down if you can ping it?
[2013-01-07 22:05:17] <soulseekah> I can't ping it anymore
[2013-01-07 22:05:32] <soulseekah> funyn how the 1st onion breaks in the browser
[2013-01-07 22:05:39] <soulseekah> if you access any html page thereof
[2013-01-07 22:05:44] <NikTitanik> ^
[2013-01-07 22:05:45] <soulseekah> it sort of starts interpreting
[2013-01-07 22:05:55] <soulseekah> with errors of course
[2013-01-07 22:06:27] <Absence_> Not a webserver. The command you typed Does not seem to exist But countless more do. %3301, unrecognized command \?\ command not found The command you typed Does not seem to exist But countless more do. Bad command or file name Not a typewriter
[2013-01-07 22:06:41] <soulseekah> Yes, it sort of breaks
[2013-01-07 22:06:51] <soulseekah> which gives us a hint about how it appears to work underneath
[2013-01-07 22:07:13] =-= bak|sleep is now known as bakpak2hvy
[2013-01-07 22:07:14] <soulseekah> my first impression what that is looked for an HTTP request header
[2013-01-07 22:07:28] <soulseekah> and stopped once it sees it, but now...
[2013-01-07 22:07:35] <soulseekah> it seems to work in a peculiar way
[2013-01-07 22:07:42] <bakpak2hvy> we figured out anything?
[2013-01-07 22:07:53] <Absence_> http://emiwp4muu2ktwknf.onion/count
[2013-01-07 22:07:54] <soulseekah> and note that this only works for html files, not other extensions
[2013-01-07 22:07:57] <Absence_> gives me the v1
[2013-01-07 22:08:00] <n00b_> When were you last on, bak?
[2013-01-07 22:08:14] <soulseekah> exactly
[2013-01-07 22:08:21] <soulseekah> it seems to react to .html
[2013-01-07 22:08:49] <NikTitanik> Absence_ refresh it
[2013-01-07 22:09:02] <bakpak2hvy> n00b_: midnightish
[2013-01-07 22:09:13] <n00b_> Time zone?
[2013-01-07 22:09:20] <Absence_> what am i refreshing

[2013-01-07 22:09:35] <bakpak2hvy> 14 horus ago
[2013-01-07 22:09:36] <NikTitanik> its only a bug that the page isnt loaded correctly
[2013-01-07 22:09:43] <NikTitanik> refresh it and it should load the whole page
[2013-01-07 22:09:49] <soulseekah> hahahaha .js is also borking
[2013-01-07 22:09:56] <bakpak2hvy> did we crack the twitter?
[2013-01-07 22:10:00] <n00b_> Ah. Decoded the Twitter stuff to an image using the mp3. That's about what I gathered
[2013-01-07 22:10:02] <soulseekah> and the <pre> is left this is peculiar
[2013-01-07 22:10:11] <bakpak2hvy> n00b_: on the wiki?
[2013-01-07 22:10:21] <n00b_> Yup. Take a look
[2013-01-07 22:10:31] <bakpak2hvy> cool
[2013-01-07 22:11:31] <soulseekah> .css is also resulting in this behavior
[2013-01-07 22:11:40] <Tech1> any interesting ID tags?
[2013-01-07 22:11:55] <soulseekah> how could this be, from a coding standpoint
[2013-01-07 22:12:11] <NikTitanik> maybe tor is just struggling with the page
[2013-01-07 22:12:22] <soulseekah> initially I thought it's a mere socket based script, but it sense .js .css and .html
[2013-01-07 22:12:24] <Absence_> wait
[2013-01-07 22:12:25] <Absence_> seekah
[2013-01-07 22:12:28] <Tech1> i doubt it thats nik, there are very complicated pages on TOR
[2013-01-07 22:12:28] <NikTitanik> im 99% sure its just a bug
[2013-01-07 22:12:31] <soulseekah> and start spewing out commands
[2013-01-07 22:12:34] <Absence_> .html .htm
[2013-01-07 22:12:35] <soulseekah> NikTitanik, exactly
[2013-01-07 22:12:45] <soulseekah> but this bug reveals wat's underneath
[2013-01-07 22:12:47] <Absence_> are returning different texts
[2013-01-07 22:12:48] <Absence_> the '404's even though they arent 404s
[2013-01-07 22:12:56] <Absence_> "Not a typewriter command not found"
[2013-01-07 22:13:03] <Tech1> soulseekah: fuzz the java console
[2013-01-07 22:13:04] <Tech1> ?

[2013-01-07 22:13:13] <Cooper5> fuzz?
[2013-01-07 22:13:24] <Tech1> fuzz == throw bullshit at it and see how it reacts
[2013-01-07 22:13:33] <soulseekah> Tech1, actually fuzzing the browser
[2013-01-07 22:13:51] <Tech1> ugh, i'm going to have to switch over to BT again, aren't i?
[2013-01-07 22:13:53] <Tech1> haha
[2013-01-07 22:13:54] <soulseekah> but I have to start throwing the console headers to see what makes it stop
[2013-01-07 22:13:59] <Cooper5> Sounds a bit like DoSing without the intent of taking it down.
[2013-01-07 22:14:05] <soulseekah> Tech1, it's actually quite peculiar
[2013-01-07 22:14:08] <Absence_> Using .php gives me the homepage
[2013-01-07 22:14:12] <Absence_> This guy is fun.
[2013-01-07 22:14:29] <soulseekah> Tech1, access the 1st onion with a .html .js .css
[2013-01-07 22:14:36] <soulseekah> and it starts reacting as if you fed it commands
[2013-01-07 22:14:44] <soulseekah> i.e. the initial parser is borked somewhat
[2013-01-07 22:14:46] <Absence_> .asp does the sme thing as .php
[2013-01-07 22:14:54] <Tech1> wtf
[2013-01-07 22:15:01] <Tech1> woah
[2013-01-07 22:15:04] <soulseekah> but only known formats
[2013-01-07 22:15:15] <soulseekah> other formats give same old
[2013-01-07 22:15:16] <bakpak2hvy> did we make anything of the pgp message?
[2013-01-07 22:15:23] <Absence_> http://prntscr.com/og8m0
[2013-01-07 22:15:24] <bakpak2hvy> or is it just there for the sig?
[2013-01-07 22:15:28] <Absence_> Got an XML parsing error.
[2013-01-07 22:15:36] <soulseekah> Absence_, it's from Firefox
[2013-01-07 22:15:37] <Absence_> They have something XML on there server; but no clue what it is.
[2013-01-07 22:15:41] <soulseekah> because it'sn ot an XML
[2013-01-07 22:15:53] <soulseekah> Absence_, no no no
[2013-01-07 22:16:08] <Butch_> >I don't even know what you people are talking about ;__;
[2013-01-07 22:16:09] <soulseekah> you're making the browser interpret the same old response as different formats
[2013-01-07 22:16:18] <n00b_> Has anyone tried converting the text the cicada is made of?
[2013-01-07 22:16:20] <soulseekah> the response is always the same
[2013-01-07 22:16:25] <Absence_> It should 404, I'm getting a reply page.
[2013-01-07 22:16:35] <NikTitanik> n00b_ converting the text to what?
[2013-01-07 22:16:59] <Tech1> soul, pm
[2013-01-07 22:17:08] <Absence_> XML Parsing Error: syntax error
[2013-01-07 22:18:04] <Absence_> Unless its something unique to there server, it should be looking at something XML
[2013-01-07 22:18:09] <n00b_> I'm not sure. I just thought it odd it was comprised mostly of 7's. Almost makes me think math, but the other charectars used don't make me think so. Also, 7 = prime (obviously)
[2013-01-07 22:18:13] <Ymgve> Absence_: yes, _your browser_ can't parse it as XMP
[2013-01-07 22:18:15] <Ymgve> XML
[2013-01-07 22:18:24] <Cooper5> I think I may have ahd too much coffee today...
[2013-01-07 22:18:25] <Ymgve> which is tries to do because you have .xml at the end
[2013-01-07 22:18:57] <Absence_> But if I request the same thing at any other website, I get a 404. Well, in this case I should get the standard thing from .html or .php
[2013-01-07 22:19:07] <soulseekah> Absence_, it gives you the same result odn't worry
[2013-01-07 22:19:17] <soulseekah> it's a bug probably, rather peculiar
[2013-01-07 22:19:18] <Ymgve> Absence_: that's because the server don't care what you type
[2013-01-07 22:19:24] |<-- Cat__ has left freenode (Quit: Page closed)
[2013-01-07 22:19:24] <artea> n00b, its also made of i's, which is the 9th letter of the alphabet, and 97/79 is one of those primes
[2013-01-07 22:19:38] <soulseekah> the bug is actually that the initial parser borks up when an extention is supplied
[2013-01-07 22:19:45] <soulseekah> and lets some of the text through to the shell
[2013-01-07 22:19:46] <n00b_> That is a true statement
[2013-01-07 22:19:51] <Absence_> The server DOES care what you type, thats why it has a 404 system, like how it breaks when u attempt to do an HTML
[2013-01-07 22:19:52] <soulseekah> which is a bug probably
[2013-01-07 22:19:59] <n00b_> I'm gonna take a gander at the character chart
[2013-01-07 22:20:17] <Absence_> I really think there is more to this.

[2013-01-07 22:20:56] <Ymgve> of course
[2013-01-07 22:21:07] <youdontknow> ahh, can't see it, no tor at work
[2013-01-07 22:21:07] <Absence_> Can anyone try to do an Anonymous FTP to the server?

[2013-01-07 22:28:23] <NikTitanik> ^
[2013-01-07 22:28:49] <NikTitanik> the line at 15.9kHz seems suspicious
[2013-01-07 22:29:06] <Ymgve> artifact I think
[2013-01-07 22:29:10] <Ymgve> I don't see it here
[2013-01-07 22:29:17] <NikTitanik> soulseekah, since you did the spectrogram, can you izolate that hum and lower it down to 5KHZ?
[2013-01-07 22:29:38] <Cursedhydra> What tool was used to achieve this image?
[2013-01-07 22:29:54] <soulseekah> NikTitanik, I'm working on something else so sorry
[2013-01-07 22:30:00] <NikTitanik> ok
[2013-01-07 22:30:01] <NikTitanik> np
[2013-01-07 22:30:02] <soulseekah> Cursedhydra, I used Audacity
[2013-01-07 22:30:09] <Cursedhydra> Ok, thanks
[2013-01-07 22:30:14] <NikTitanik> did you use a plugin?
[2013-01-07 22:30:14] <soulseekah> I found 2 peculiar things
[2013-01-07 22:30:26] <soulseekah> a constant hum at 15.4-16.1kHz, and empty notches under 500Hz starting from 1:56. This could be significant.
[2013-01-07 22:30:59] <soulseekah> the notches are not natural, whereas the hum could be natural
[2013-01-07 22:31:03] <n00b_> I'm no good with Audacity, but I have it handy. I'll see what I can do
[2013-01-07 22:31:04] <soulseekah> i.e. hardware
[2013-01-07 22:31:13] <soulseekah> NikTitanik, no plugin vanilla Audacity on Linux
[2013-01-07 22:31:14] <Absence_> Soulseekah : Could it be a safe assumption that there is atleast one XML on the server since its giving me the error. It is also saying "Web browsers are useless here." with "^" below it. Something is being parsed.
[2013-01-07 22:31:24] <Ymgve> Absence_: no
[2013-01-07 22:31:33] <NikTitanik> okk
[2013-01-07 22:32:00] <soulseekah> Absence_, no
[2013-01-07 22:32:25] <soulseekah> Absence_, you are forcing the webbrowser to iterpret the data with whatever extention you're feeding it
[2013-01-07 22:32:36] <soulseekah> the data is the same (at least the top part)
[2013-01-07 22:32:48] <soulseekah> but the bug is being explored in other ways
[2013-01-07 22:32:55] <soulseekah> there's something there
[2013-01-07 22:33:03] <soulseekah> to these extentions dropping through
[2013-01-07 22:33:13] <Absence_> But I should get the usual repsonse; this one is completely different from the rest. I guess I see what you mean, just seems odd. It never happens like that on every another website.

[2013-01-07 22:39:25] <soulseekah> you're trying to feed it borked XML - it vomits

[2013-01-07 22:42:38] <n00b_> Lol. I think I hear it. Need to go just a tiny bit lower

[2013-01-07 22:43:02] <n00b_> Thats more than what I know how to do lol

[2013-01-07 22:44:33] <soulseekah> but on the other hand it seems as if its working off a webserver
[2013-01-07 22:44:54] <Absence_> Would a python script like the one he used for the twitter be hard to do?

[2013-01-07 22:45:47] <ganon> there's a twitter api wrap for python
[2013-01-07 22:45:48] <soulseekah> the implementation is not relevant
[2013-01-07 22:45:48] <Absence_> If this is sovled
[2013-01-07 22:45:56] <Absence_> I think we should do a re-creation version

[2013-01-07 23:12:05] <n00b_> Is the Twitter page even relevant anymore?

[2013-01-07 23:12:29] <coqu1> the still need to xor every byte
[2013-01-07 23:12:52] <lulzorz> see, this is what happens when we give the onion addrs to everyone and his dog
[2013-01-07 23:13:09] <chimp> its probably more likely that ymgve broke it
[2013-01-07 23:13:14] <chimp> with his mad skill
[2013-01-07 23:13:34] <youdontknow> unless the twitter feed is just a decoy, i'd say not, otherwise why would it's rate keep getting manipulated
[2013-01-07 23:13:47] <youdontknow> i haven't really looked, but how was the subreddit used last year?
[2013-01-07 23:13:47] <Ymgve> maybe it's because of twitter
[2013-01-07 23:13:57] <chimp> if it was a decoy, at some point woudnt it say "this is a decoy" right?
[2013-01-07 23:14:00] <Ymgve> some API that tells it "you can't tweet for N minutes"
[2013-01-07 23:14:01] <chimp> i mean how long has it been going
[2013-01-07 23:14:23] <soulseekah> There's at least a 350 call limit per hour last time I checked
[2013-01-07 23:14:33] <Tech1> 99% sure it is max 350
[2013-01-07 23:15:06] <primius> maybe they took it down because they noticed it was totes doxd
[2013-01-07 23:15:37] <rr645> The subreddit last continued to happily post long after it was useless. It was used to help find a book for a book code
[2013-01-07 23:15:52] <Ymgve> anyway: http://pastebin.com/QwTuz1D9
[2013-01-07 23:16:03] <Ymgve> this is what you get if you type "hint" into the console
[2013-01-07 23:16:21] <soulseekah> great, now that it's out there let's discuss the forest
[2013-01-07 23:16:22] <NikTitanik> waaaaa
[2013-01-07 23:16:26] <Ymgve> and xor with _560.00 at offset 0
[2013-01-07 23:16:30] <soulseekah> could the forest be the image of the cicada?
[2013-01-07 23:16:31] <rr645> Interesting whitespacing in that hint
[2013-01-07 23:16:39] <NikTitanik> i know what it is
[2013-01-07 23:16:40] <soulseekah> in the console
[2013-01-07 23:16:49] <soulseekah> looks like a lot of trees/forest
[2013-01-07 23:16:50] <NikTitanik> its a hint that we need to look at the tweets as whole
[2013-01-07 23:17:04] <NikTitanik> its a hint that we should combine the tweets, as we already did
[2013-01-07 23:17:20] <soulseekah> but the tweets so far have been clear
[2013-01-07 23:17:21] <soulseekah> no?
[2013-01-07 23:17:26] <NikTitanik> yes
[2013-01-07 23:17:35] <soulseekah> so as a whole they are so far clear to us

[2013-01-07 23:17:44] <Cuboid3301> Hey
[2013-01-07 23:17:46] <NikTitanik> but maybe the hint was meant for if we still didnt know what the tweets are
[2013-01-07 23:17:49] <soulseekah> I see
[2013-01-07 23:17:49] <Cuboid3301> What is new?
[2013-01-07 23:17:57] <coqu1> it means we need to broaden our thinking
[2013-01-07 23:18:08] <Ymgve> NikTitanik: we aren't even supposed to have been this far without all the tweets
[2013-01-07 23:18:09] <soulseekah> or we're past the hint, as NikTitanik suggested
[2013-01-07 23:18:20] <n00b_> Look at the bigger picture. What ever that is
[2013-01-07 23:18:41] <Tech1> did they do false trails last year?
[2013-01-07 23:18:51] <G[k]> Then does that mean that the runic table will be useful when the second onion site comes back up?
[2013-01-07 23:18:58] <Tech1> *if* G[k]
[2013-01-07 23:19:01] <lulzorz> Ymgve: no, they clearly used repetetive padding after the png to make it so we could predict the rest
[2013-01-07 23:19:04] <G[k]> True
[2013-01-07 23:19:15] <lulzorz> Ymgve: the only purpose of the png was to provide random padding so we couldn't get them all immediately

[2013-01-07 23:19:58] <n00b_> I think the forest hint was talking about the tweets

[2013-01-07 23:20:25] <n00b_> And I agree with you lol
[2013-01-07 23:20:26] <Cooper5> I suppose before I went to work I should have checked to make sure I was working today...
[2013-01-07 23:20:28] <soulseekah> could we have gotten the hint without doing the tweets?
[2013-01-07 23:20:51] <Ymgve> soulseekah: no
[2013-01-07 23:20:53] <soulseekah> 1st onion came from tab-spaces file
[2013-01-07 23:20:56] <soulseekah> which came from
[2013-01-07 23:21:08] <soulseekah> k
[2013-01-07 23:21:15] <NikTitanik> no, the second onion came from spaces
[2013-01-07 23:21:16] <Ymgve> tab-spaces file came from outguess on the _full_ rune image
[2013-01-07 23:21:23] <NikTitanik> eh
[2013-01-07 23:21:33] <NikTitanik> i guess the hint doesnt have to do with the tweets then
[2013-01-07 23:22:06] <n00b_> Well then, what is it we're examining too closely?
[2013-01-07 23:22:08] <rr645> Last year there was a graphical map of what lead to what--it helped resolve some questions of what lead to what
[2013-01-07 23:22:20] <Tech1> yeah, rr, that's not a terrible idea
[2013-01-07 23:22:22] <soulseekah> the commands perhaps, trying every possible tree
[2013-01-07 23:22:27] <Tech1> the info on the wiki right?
[2013-01-07 23:22:42] <NikTitanik> so i converted the 761.mp3 to 16bit pcm, what now?
[2013-01-07 23:22:56] <Tech1> it'll be UGLY, but effective, if you guys gimme a minute
[2013-01-07 23:23:12] <Tech1> oh fuck this.  Maltego case file bitches.
[2013-01-07 23:23:21] <soulseekah> NikTitanik, hexdump and look at the end perhaps
[2013-01-07 23:23:29] <NikTitanik> ok
[2013-01-07 23:23:38] <n00b_> You guys are inputting commands in the Linux thing, yea?
[2013-01-07 23:23:39] <soulseekah> around half of the file, 60%
[2013-01-07 23:23:39] <Cooper5> Okay so did I miss anything in the 30 minutes I was gone?
[2013-01-07 23:23:46] <soulseekah> n00b_, sure
[2013-01-07 23:24:02] <NikTitanik> n00b_ its not only linux, i have it on windows, you just need putty
[2013-01-07 23:24:07] <Flumentia> Just saying, the forest hint has nothing to do with the tweets. We found the forest hint by first looking at the tweets to make the file, then using the file to get the onion site.
[2013-01-07 23:24:20] =-= iII|out is now known as iIIustrious

[2013-01-07 23:24:58] <NikTitanik> but...?
[2013-01-07 23:25:07] <Tech1> throw the source on dropbox or something open, edit as needed
[2013-01-07 23:25:24] <Tech1> got distracted.
[2013-01-07 23:25:25] <n00b_> I was talking about the distro. The one with the cicada splash screen and prime numbers. I was wondering if anyone knows the un/pw for that
[2013-01-07 23:25:42] <soulseekah> n00b_, the passwd file is empty
[2013-01-07 23:25:48] <soulseekah> there are no users
[2013-01-07 23:25:56] <soulseekah> max you can seem to do is mount hte filesystem

[2013-01-07 23:26:03] <soulseekah> to look at the .sh script

[2013-01-07 23:34:02] <Flumentia> Judging by the fact they use linux it could be any of them. I'd say we might have to get the data or something? Maybe the spaces are the 'trees'?

[2013-01-07 23:34:59] <Flumentia> Good point. Also, they're all ordinary spaces. he first one just LOOKS bigger
[2013-01-07 23:35:01] <soulseekah> Flumentia, what? why? the only characters present as whitespace are 0x0a and 0x20

[2013-01-08 00:03:58] <JackHinds> it's actually slowed down in the original mp3
[2013-01-08 00:04:19] <JackHinds> i was just experimenting and the last part sounded more genuine whilst being speeded up
[2013-01-08 00:04:48] <G[k]> I do kind of have to agree with that. It sounds more natural isolated at that speed.
[2013-01-08 00:05:11] <NikT|mob> I heared that drum beat somewhere
[2013-01-08 00:05:19] <rr645> JackHinds have you tried it sped up and reversed?
[2013-01-08 00:05:31] <G[k]> I was just about to try that
[2013-01-08 00:05:52] <rr645> The higher part sounds much better
[2013-01-08 00:07:52] <G[k]> Interesting...
[2013-01-08 00:07:58] <NikT|mob> ?
[2013-01-08 00:08:12] <JackHinds> there's one instrument that's reversed
[2013-01-08 00:08:15] <G[k]> When you reverse Jack's sped up file the high bits sound similar to a Japanese uh
[2013-01-08 00:08:17] <G[k]> What is it
[2013-01-08 00:08:25] <G[k]> Two strings and it's plucked
[2013-01-08 00:08:49] <JackHinds> don't know but you're right
[2013-01-08 00:08:55] <NikT|mob> The thing thats put in the mounth?
[2013-01-08 00:08:59] <G[k]> I should know this too lol

[2013-01-08 00:09:11] <G[k]> A shamisen
[2013-01-08 00:09:13] <JackHinds> and the sound at the end of the reversed version also sounds japanese
[2013-01-08 00:09:29] <G[k]> At least I was right with my "oriental" hunch
[2013-01-08 00:10:02] <artea> 3 strings, not 2 :p
[2013-01-08 00:10:09] <rr645> Yes! It definitely sounds like a shamisen. Do you know if there's a standard tuning for those?
[2013-01-08 00:10:12] <G[k]> Well I was close lol

[2013-01-08 00:10:47] <JackHinds> maybe the notes of the reversed instrument

[2013-01-08 00:31:13] <V17Ds> hah
[2013-01-08 00:31:17] <V17Ds> i love these puzzles
[2013-01-08 00:31:18] -->| tapez (83d7dca6@gateway/web/freenode/ip.131.215.220.166) has joined #33012013
[2013-01-08 00:31:19] <bak|remote> ok, whats our current clue?
[2013-01-08 00:31:25] <V17Ds> but i can never know how to do them correctly
[2013-01-08 00:31:29] <ArtemisX> ymgve i doubt 3301 people r involved
[2013-01-08 00:31:47] <Cursedhydra> I proposed this being a troll before
[2013-01-08 00:31:51] <Ymgve> "You can't see the forest when you're looking at the trees." is the current clue
[2013-01-08 00:31:57] <Cursedhydra> It would have stopped long before this.
[2013-01-08 00:32:05] <ArtemisX> i believe 3301 will prove useful further along
[2013-01-08 00:32:19] <ArtemisX> cursed it could be trickery not a troll per say
[2013-01-08 00:32:33] <Cooper5> a file tree?
[2013-01-08 00:32:43] <n00b_> I'm currently just here for the ride. This is all above my head, just here to make useless suggestions
[2013-01-08 00:32:52] <ArtemisX> then dont suggest just read my son
[2013-01-08 00:32:54] <V17Ds> wait, Ym
[2013-01-08 00:32:58] <V17Ds> that seems very very familiar
[2013-01-08 00:33:09] <indigo_> n00b_ : Then you fit your usename, eh :D
[2013-01-08 00:33:13] <bak|remote> have we figured out what to do with the jpg from the twitter?
[2013-01-08 00:33:40] <Ymgve> bak|remote: yes, with a bit of trickery we managed to get the image before the twitter has finished
[2013-01-08 00:33:56] <n00b_> Yea:) Thought I'd use this as opposed to my normal usernames
[2013-01-08 00:34:05] <V17Ds> hm
[2013-01-08 00:34:07] <Ymgve> it lead us to the onion sites
[2013-01-08 00:34:13] <bak|remote> oh
[2013-01-08 00:34:15] <Ymgve> well, first site
[2013-01-08 00:34:17] <bak|remote> havent seen those yet
[2013-01-08 00:34:24] <Cooper5> Cant see the forest if you're looking at the trees is a phrase that means you can't see what's right in front of you if you're looking at al the little details.
[2013-01-08 00:34:26] <V17Ds> "Can't see the forest for the trees" and "You can't see the forest when you're looking at the trees"
[2013-01-08 00:34:39] <V17Ds> broader
[2013-01-08 00:34:57] <V17Ds> hm
[2013-01-08 00:35:00] <ArtemisX> hmmmmm
[2013-01-08 00:35:03] <Cooper5> So, we are looking too closely...
[2013-01-08 00:35:15] <V17Ds> i think its something on the twitter
[2013-01-08 00:35:28] <Cooper5> Maybe referring to something in the physical world?

[2013-01-08 00:37:45] <V17Ds> i think there might be something there

[2013-01-08 00:42:45] <Cursedhydra> ^ How did we get to that clue?
[2013-01-08 00:42:58] <ArtemisX> idea
[2013-01-08 00:43:25] <ArtemisX> the clue... what if it means we r looking at the wrong place?
[2013-01-08 00:43:36] <Ymgve> Cursedhydra type "hint" in the onion1 console

[2013-01-08 00:43:42] <V17Ds> hm
[2013-01-08 00:43:47] <ArtemisX> trees r an extension of a forest
[2013-01-08 00:43:51] <ArtemisX> so go back to the source
[2013-01-08 00:43:54] <Cooper5> Try again.
[2013-01-08 00:43:58] <Ymgve> then xor the result with the start of _560.00

[2013-01-08 00:46:27] <Cursedhydra> I'm still on the music
[2013-01-08 00:46:48] <G[k]> Cursedhydra: Have you gotten anything else so far?
[2013-01-08 00:48:03] <rr645> I've only got the first few notes of shamisen in reverse, still trying to work out the best way to listen to it
[2013-01-08 00:48:05] <V17Ds> hurm
[2013-01-08 00:48:13] <V17Ds> cant get it to start on ubuntu

[2013-01-08 00:50:43] <n00b_> Thought: Exactly what range is the high pitch hum in the mp3? I remember someone saying when it was lowered, it was cicadas. Would they put that there for a reason? Maybe find a mean between the highest part of it, and the lowest part of the hum

[2013-01-08 00:52:13] <immortalghost> where did we get that?
[2013-01-08 00:52:21] <ArtemisX> GUYS GOT SOMETHING

[2013-01-08 00:53:02] <iII|away> LOL

[2013-01-08 01:53:00] <leakhmskill> in 'Murica, each class has a point value with the grade you get, a,b,c,d,f

[2013-01-08 01:53:28] <leakhmskill> then you add them all together and divide by the number of classes
[2013-01-08 01:53:58] <leakhmskill> and weighted classes (honors and AP) get an extra point for the difficulty level

[2013-01-08 02:04:09] <G[k]> And when sped up you hear a higher pitch in the background

[2013-01-08 02:17:59] <MiKa1> interesting is also that there is a short burst at the 16kHz range at the beginning of the mp3 and then quite a long silence

[2013-01-08 02:18:48] <Cosmo_> I had a look around
[2013-01-08 02:19:10] <Cosmo_> The closest thing I've got is the sound of actual cicada's. No amaount of analysis is showing anything hidden in it yet
[2013-01-08 02:19:11] <MiKa1> no - sharp cutover around 8Khz, just look at the high band

[2013-01-08 03:15:25] <rr645> Yes--but in this case, all the numbers are primes. So each compound that the gematria produced would be unique to that string of letters.

[2013-01-08 03:30:49] <fasd> thanks
[2013-01-08 03:31:33] <Cosmo> Did you use w instead of v? That's what I'd do

[2013-01-08 03:32:03] <JackHinds> that's what i did
[2013-01-08 03:32:03] <n_factor> JackHinds, v is evaluated as u
[2013-01-08 03:32:17] <JackHinds> ok
[2013-01-08 03:32:43] <n_factor> if you go to the 3301 onion and type count q or count v you can find their values
[2013-01-08 03:33:37] <Cosmo> 8931331293159103 then?
[2013-01-08 03:33:52] <n_factor> for what?

[2013-01-08 03:34:04] <n_factor> you want the factors?
[2013-01-08 03:34:08] <JackHinds> yea
[2013-01-08 03:34:09] <JackHinds> i have them

[2013-01-08 03:34:32] <absolutezeroff> so is that what we telnet with
[2013-01-08 03:34:35] <n_factor> you can factor pretty fast there son
[2013-01-08 03:34:39] <JackHinds> are there any missing numbers in the hex?
[2013-01-08 03:34:45] <JackHinds> well i've been at it for 15 minutes
[2013-01-08 03:34:47] <crash_demons> are you trying to edge-case the factorization?
[2013-01-08 03:34:56] <n_factor> here, try a real number: 10412790658919985359827898739594318956404425106955675643739226952372682423852959081739834390370374475764863415203423499357108713631
[2013-01-08 03:35:04] <crash_demons> lol.
[2013-01-08 03:35:07] <n_factor> it's a RSA semiprime
[2013-01-08 03:35:13] <n_factor> not that many digits
[2013-01-08 03:35:14] <n_factor> really
[2013-01-08 03:35:23] <absolutezeroff> so uh

[2013-01-08 03:41:13] <n_factor> that was the final message last year.
[2013-01-08 03:41:24] <perplexed_> i have no idea how to connect to it crash_demons
[2013-01-08 03:41:31] <perplexed_> never used tor or netcat before
[2013-01-08 03:41:32] <n_factor> oh noes
[2013-01-08 03:41:37] <n_factor> people in here have to learn to tor
[2013-01-08 03:41:39] <n_factor> and nc
[2013-01-08 03:41:45] <n_factor> what will we ever do
[2013-01-08 03:42:27] <absolutezeroff> I've downloaded the tor browser
[2013-01-08 03:42:34] <perplexed_> care to explain it slowly n factor?
[2013-01-08 03:42:35] <pr0_> lol
[2013-01-08 03:42:51] <fasd> just want to be sure the second onion starts with xsxn?
[2013-01-08 03:43:30] <pr0_> wheres the anon that discovered the runes?
[2013-01-08 03:43:52] <JackHinds_> well
[2013-01-08 03:43:53] <JackHinds_> i have windows
[2013-01-08 03:44:06] <JackHinds_> so i'm gonna go gaming like mad

[2013-01-08 03:44:45] <Cosmo_> The guy who found the picture isn't here right now
[2013-01-08 03:45:13] <pr0_> hello cosmo
[2013-01-08 03:45:24] <Cosmo_> hello
[2013-01-08 03:45:28] <pr0_> did u get to analyze further the mp3
[2013-01-08 03:46:14] <crash_demons> "learn tor" = click a button and enter "localhost:9050" ?
[2013-01-08 03:46:20] <Cosmo_> I did. I looked at the random frequency spikes that were brought up. I took apart the audio itself
[2013-01-08 03:46:36] <Cosmo_> all i found was a poor recording. However, if there's something coded in there
[2013-01-08 03:46:40] <crash_demons> all tor does for me is piss me off re:bandwidth :p
[2013-01-08 03:46:41] <Cosmo_> I can't find it
[2013-01-08 03:47:12] [INFO] Font size is 14pt
[2013-01-08 03:47:24] <Cosmo_> Not without a starting point of what i'm looking for.
[2013-01-08 03:47:24] <pr0_> maybe that was all then and now we gotta decipher what the runes are for
[2013-01-08 03:47:28] <Lurker69> fasd: did you get second address yet?
[2013-01-08 03:48:09] [INFO] Font size is default
[2013-01-08 03:48:09] <absolutezeroff> it starts was xsxn right
[2013-01-08 03:48:10] <pr0_> any progress on the parable?
[2013-01-08 03:48:10] <fasd> does it start with xsxn? because if it does I have it and can not connect
[2013-01-08 03:48:11] <absolutezeroff> Yeah, same here fasd
[2013-01-08 03:48:31] <Cosmo_> Nothing other than converting them from the rune table and finding prime factors with the onions
[2013-01-08 03:48:33] <Lurker69> fasd: yea
[2013-01-08 03:48:34] <pr0_> the parable number i mean
[2013-01-08 03:48:49] <absolutezeroff> so do we just use nc with the address?
[2013-01-08 03:48:55] <fasd> I think we just need to keep trying I remember seeing other people with this problem
[2013-01-08 03:48:58] <Lurker69> fasd: there are still multiple ways to find it (try searchind pastebin)
[2013-01-08 03:49:35] <JackHinds_> so what's the telnetting supposed to be?
[2013-01-08 03:49:56] <Lurker69> JackHinds_: Nothing other than converting them from the rune table and finding prime factors with the onions

[2013-01-08 05:21:25] <artea> The rune poem itself does not provide the names of the runes. Rather, each stanza is a riddle, to which the rune name is the solution.

[2013-01-08 05:41:40] <rr645> Cosmo, could Hendrix tuning be an artifact of speed changes?
[2013-01-08 05:41:56] <Grazza> nice
[2013-01-08 05:42:34] <Cosmo>  I wa just thinking that, it could be. But every string is tuned relatively and it stays in tune throughout the first two sections (Haven't done the drum section yet) So as far as i can tell this is actually intentional
[2013-01-08 05:43:22] <n_factor> you know, audacity has a filter to change speed without changing pitch
[2013-01-08 05:43:39] <Cosmo> Yeah but it actually does change the pitch slightly, it's imperfect
[2013-01-08 05:43:53] <n_factor> lol
[2013-01-08 05:43:54] <Cosmo> It's just occured to me.... Hang on let me check something
[2013-01-08 05:43:58] <n_factor> 3301 is far from imperfect
[2013-01-08 05:44:23] <n_factor> it makes sense that there would be a backmasking track layed on it
[2013-01-08 05:44:37] <n_factor> since everything in the game is pointing to reading things from both directions
[2013-01-08 05:44:56] <n_factor> i wonder if .17 needs to be reversed to xor it with something
[2013-01-08 05:44:57] <rr645> n_factor you mean the backwards shamisen?
[2013-01-08 05:45:36] <Flumentia> Going to write that post now. I'll do it on the wiki so others can have it. But better formatting this time.
[2013-01-08 05:45:41] <n_factor> there are definately strikes with decay when played backwards
[2013-01-08 05:46:15] <lulzorz> changing speed and pitch independently is going to totally fuck up your phases
[2013-01-08 05:46:18] <n_factor> i dunno what instrument it is
[2013-01-08 05:46:19] <n_factor> did you work out the tabs yet so we can all learn it?
[2013-01-08 05:46:33] <Cosmo> Those bastards.  The song is not it's original speed
[2013-01-08 05:46:45] <Cosmo> it's around 5% slower.
[2013-01-08 05:46:50] <n_factor> hmm
[2013-01-08 05:46:57] <Flumentia> How do you knw??
[2013-01-08 05:46:59] <Cosmo> From what we can tell, we're still working on it
[2013-01-08 05:47:07] <n_factor> wonder if they streched it to fit the backmasked track
[2013-01-08 05:47:23] <onon> link to the track plx?
[2013-01-08 05:47:25] <rr645> To fit the prime number of seconds, too
[2013-01-08 05:47:26] <Flumentia> Ah K. Try speeding it up and removing the backmask and shazaming it
[2013-01-08 05:47:27] <Cosmo> Well it was the tempo's they're so strange. 125 instead of 120 is a weird one
[2013-01-08 05:47:52] <onon> y would 125 be weird?
[2013-01-08 05:47:55] <Grazza> is that why u say its slower?
[2013-01-08 05:48:28] <Cosmo> No....right give me 2 minutes I'll have a full explanation of WHY we think it, we could be wrong, bear with me
[2013-01-08 05:48:53] <onon> someone have the link to he track pls?
[2013-01-08 05:48:54] <n_factor> question
[2013-01-08 05:48:59] <n_factor> is there a difference in the stereo tracks?
[2013-01-08 05:49:55] <Cosmo> Ok, let me tell you what I know for SURE, then i'll tell ou what I think. Firstly there is no backmasking that is audible in reversed play, that is quite simply a reversed guitar (there's only 2 instruments in this track)
[2013-01-08 05:50:23] <Cosmo> To play along with it now you need a guitar to hendrix tuning (e flat) with a dropped d
[2013-01-08 05:50:26] <onon> are u guys talking about 761.mp3 or is there a new one?
[2013-01-08 05:50:54] <Cosmo> That tuning is slowly being phased out as people use e standard more and more. The bpm changes in the song, arround 135, to 145 to 125
[2013-01-08 05:51:04] <n_factor> the tracks are different between left and right.  do you think they used stereo mics?
[2013-01-08 05:51:40] <Cosmo> The mix levels are different yeah, but that could be put down to a panning issue, I have slowed both tracks down and split the audio track to check both tracks and i can't personally hear a difference
[2013-01-08 05:51:54] <Cosmo> plus mp3 conversion usually nullify a lot of stereo panned mixes
[2013-01-08 05:52:18] <Cosmo> Here's what we THINK, so just consider it brain food, and an idea
[2013-01-08 05:52:35] <absolutezeroff> onon: 761 i believe
[2013-01-08 05:52:36] <onon> *cough would somebody be so kind to point me to the track
[2013-01-08 05:52:39] <onon> ah k
[2013-01-08 05:53:30] <pr0_> could there be messages hidden in the sounds?
[2013-01-08 05:53:42] <Cosmo> Even tuned to the hendrix  tuning the guitar isn't QUITE in tune, but on the recording it is 'relatively' in tune to itself. That's normally a pointer to a speed change. That and the odd choices of bpm. But here's what's confusing us. If they changed the speed of the track to be 167 seconds.... Wouldn't it have been easier to just make that original 'breath' sound at the beginning longer?
[2013-01-08 05:54:19] <Grazza> yeah, unless theres a msg in the breath sound as well?
[2013-01-08 05:54:21] <Cosmo> If there's a hidden message I have no way of hearing or finding it right now, but that doesn't mean it's not there. By all means, take a look yourselves
[2013-01-08 05:54:30] <Cosmo> The breath sound caught my attention first
[2013-01-08 05:55:04] <Cosmo> I've been going over and over, there's no palindromic effect, no backmasked message, no message recorded in an unhearable frequency. What it resembles most is the song of cicadas
[2013-01-08 05:55:35] <lulzorz> any trace of digital stego?
[2013-01-08 05:55:39] <Cosmo> more correctly, cicadas in a forest. The ones we can't see for the trees ;) Hahaha! But that's taking it too far

[2013-01-08 05:56:23] <Cosmo> There's some odd frequencies missing or in some cases added, but nothing that couldn't come from bad equalisation in a master mix. That's where I leave it to you guys, i just simply don't have the software to take it apart on that level
[2013-01-08 05:56:59] <lulzorz> yeah, I'm not familiar with mp3 stego at all, sorry
[2013-01-08 05:57:07] <lulzorz> I was just wondering if it "sounded weird"

[2013-01-08 05:57:47] <rr645> Cosmo, that odd line above 15k in the stereogram--is that something that you'd see normally as a recording artifact?
[2013-01-08 05:57:57] <Cosmo> Normally it rquires some kind of reference sound, a key, but as of yet i've no idea where to get one. I was considering the cicada sound but it'd be impossilbe to isolate the right parts even if that's the case.
[2013-01-08 05:58:32] <Cosmo> That odd line is the other thing I've been looking at. Honestly.... I've never seen anything like it before, but it shows no sign of being.....anything
[2013-01-08 05:58:56] <Cosmo> It's too high for background noise, to constant for assonance or pops, too high for ambient noise

[2013-01-08 06:10:57] <iIIustrious> can't see the forest for the trees is a phrase I've heard associated with fractals, complexity at zoomed in and grander focus

[2013-01-08 06:33:37] <artea> rr, did anyone actually get anywhere with it though? it seems people are glossing over it
[2013-01-08 06:33:57] <zackt8> Google Gematria database and you'll see what I mean
[2013-01-08 06:34:31] <zackt8> People are definitely glossing it over. I asked a friend of mine who is all into this occult shit
[2013-01-08 06:34:41] <Cosmo> Well I found the aphabet it's copied off of, really it's just connecting the numbers to it now
[2013-01-08 06:35:22] <zackt8> She said that it sounds good but we need a database of things that are connected by the numbers in order to actually DO anything with it.
[2013-01-08 06:35:46] <artea> cosmo: im pretty sure the combonation of letters are from the anglo saxon rune poem... The rune poem itself does not provide the names of the runes. Rather, each stanza is a riddle, to which the rune name is the solution.
[2013-01-08 06:36:32] <Cosmo> There's a link to the wiki page that has an alphabet that is symbol for symbol the same as the one given to us by 3301
[2013-01-08 06:36:42] <zackt8> Yeah, she looked at it an kinda freaked out some. She basically said that the Anglo-Saxon futhorc runes were the first alphabet Eglish was written in, so it made sense to use that as the order, but get this: nobody's ever done that before.
[2013-01-08 06:37:13] <artea> cosmo: read the wiki again, it states the 29 letter one is from that specific rune poem
[2013-01-08 06:37:32] <Cosmo> Sorry i'm obviously getting mixed up, I'll do that
[2013-01-08 06:37:48] <anon132> whats with the skipping at the end of the song?
[2013-01-08 06:38:07] <artea> also, apparently the rune poem is said to be a key to divinity
[2013-01-08 06:38:11] <zackt8> Anyway, she said for a Gematria to do any good, you have to calculate the number for a bunch of words and phrases and then look for connections. I think that's what we need to do.
[2013-01-08 06:38:19] <artea> which ties back into the poem with 3 lines changed into 3 primes
[2013-01-08 06:38:25] <artea> i think its a huge riddle that hasnt been solved yet
[2013-01-08 06:38:55] <iIIustrious> so what we need is to use the count they've given us to find numeric conncetions between cicada relevant words

[2013-01-08 06:52:03] <anon132> palindromes
[2013-01-08 06:52:12] <Grazza> this is so confusing
[2013-01-08 06:52:15] <Grazza> so many palindromes
[2013-01-08 06:52:16] <Flumentia_> Oh. My. God.
[2013-01-08 06:52:23] <Grazza> there must be something we have to do with them
[2013-01-08 06:52:26] <Flumentia_> Someone compile that twitter message, backwards.
[2013-01-08 06:52:45] <perplexed_> why?
[2013-01-08 06:52:50] <Flumentia_> Like, literally flip the whole thing around and run it
[2013-01-08 06:52:57] <Flumentia_> It's a palindrome. The offset is 0
[2013-01-08 06:53:10] <perplexed_> wouldn't it be exactly the same?
[2013-01-08 06:53:27] <leakhmskill> not neccessarily
[2013-01-08 06:53:40] <Flumentia_> Wait, explain xoring
[2013-01-08 06:53:45] <leakhmskill> they have so nuch emphasis on things backwards as well as forwards
[2013-01-08 06:53:50] <Flumentia_> I may have been a little confuzzled
[2013-01-08 06:53:55] <leakhmskill> so, forwards doesn't work, try it backwards
[2013-01-08 06:54:22] <Flumentia_> Anyway, we performed another operation on the forwards twitter message.
[2013-01-08 06:54:24] <Flumentia_> Before running it.
[2013-01-08 06:54:42] <perplexed_> Wouldn't hurt to try, anyone here able to do it?
[2013-01-08 06:54:50] <Cosmo> For anyone interested this is the FIRST section of the tab to the music
[2013-01-08 06:54:51] <Cosmo> http://i.imgur.com/1Kgb2.png
[2013-01-08 06:55:02] <Grazza> nice
[2013-01-08 06:55:36] <Cosmo> The next part is almost exactly the same as the intro, the final section is the same as section one with a bass drum and random effects with some random notes
[2013-01-08 06:55:43] <anon132> wait, if its a palindrome do it forwards, and backwards
[2013-01-08 06:55:51] <rr645_sleep> Excellent, Cosmo
[2013-01-08 06:56:03] <perplexed_> Cosmo, if there's a code in it it could be the chord progression
[2013-01-08 06:56:11] <perplexed_> and then we could try running it through the runes
[2013-01-08 06:56:25] <Cosmo> That's the problem. The bass is just a drone note, a D flat
[2013-01-08 06:56:44] <perplexed_> what's the key?
[2013-01-08 06:56:48] <Cosmo> In one section it changes to be 7530
[2013-01-08 06:57:03] <Flumentia_> Try putting the tab through the rune system. Maybe we'll get something...
[2013-01-08 06:57:15] <Cosmo> uhhh, good question.....G flat?
[2013-01-08 06:57:35] <perplexed_> or Db or F#
[2013-01-08 06:57:49] <Cosmo> I Think......I can't actually read music. I'm ashamed to say after 13 years of playing it I can't read it
[2013-01-08 06:57:56] <perplexed_> Couldn't put the tab through it
[2013-01-08 06:58:25] <Cosmo> It's based around a pentatonic on e flat....that means the relative major should be G flat...I think
[2013-01-08 06:58:50] <perplexed_> but in music each chord is numbered 1-7
[2013-01-08 06:58:52] <perplexed_> we could put that through it
[2013-01-08 06:59:16] <Grazza> thats true
[2013-01-08 06:59:30] <Cosmo> 1-7? There's 11 notes. Do you mean intervals?
[2013-01-08 06:59:57] <Grazza> like do-re-mi
[2013-01-08 07:00:02] <Grazza> do is 1 and re is 2
[2013-01-08 07:00:06] <Grazza> for each scale
[2013-01-08 07:00:15] <Cosmo> That's just a major scale.
[2013-01-08 07:00:26] <Grazza> nvm
[2013-01-08 07:00:29] <Grazza> wrong thing
[2013-01-08 07:01:11] <Cosmo> Major scales have 8 notes, the 8th being the octave. hey miss some notes. The use the interval 2 2 1 2 2 2 1
[2013-01-08 07:01:17] <Flumentia_> I'm updating the wiki page, am I allowed to include the address for the second onion or not?
[2013-01-08 07:01:57] <perplexed_> include everything
[2013-01-08 07:02:06] <perplexed_> aslong as its accurate
[2013-01-08 07:02:23] <Flumentia_> I think I'll leave it until an OP says otherwise. They got pretty pissed when someone shared it with me, and it's redacted all over the wiki page.
[2013-01-08 07:02:29] <Flumentia_> I'll ask them later.
[2013-01-08 07:02:40] <Grazza> yeah
[2013-01-08 07:02:42] <Cosmo> Grazza: I'd avoid looking for numbers in the music. Bear in mind without sheet music the tab i've given you is what I can HEAR. There's plenty more ways to play that that will give you different numbers
[2013-01-08 07:02:46] <perplexed_> pissed?
[2013-01-08 07:02:51] <Grazza> ok
[2013-01-08 07:02:55] <Grazza> i'll look at it a little
[2013-01-08 07:03:03] <Grazza> i'll ask my brother who knows a lot of music too
[2013-01-08 07:03:06] <perplexed_> cosmo just the chords though
[2013-01-08 07:03:16] <perplexed_> let me listen again
[2013-01-08 07:03:24] <Cosmo> There are no chords, it uses a drone bass note
[2013-01-08 07:03:32] <leakhmskill> something just hit me
[2013-01-08 07:03:45] <Cosmo> No not drone....the other one....like dron....step? GCSE music is not serving well
[2013-01-08 07:03:48] <Cosmo> what?
[2013-01-08 07:03:49] <leakhmskill> what if most of the rune page is usless
[2013-01-08 07:04:06] <leakhmskill> and we only need certain runes, letters and numbers?

[2013-01-08 07:05:00] <leakhmskill> and we use the song notes to find the message
[2013-01-08 07:05:04] <Grazza> also
[2013-01-08 07:05:23] <Grazza> isnt the whole point of gematia to be able to change words into numbers in a meaningful way?
[2013-01-08 07:05:36] <Grazza> if we only used some of it, then the words would be very limited
[2013-01-08 07:05:47] <Grazza> unless it isnt supposed to be used that way
[2013-01-08 07:06:04] <artea> 1031 • 1229 • 1259    ---those are the 3 prime numbers from the parable number
[2013-01-08 07:06:12] <artea> all 3 reversible primes
[2013-01-08 07:06:20] <artea> gotten from the gematria table
[2013-01-08 07:06:24] <perplexed_> reversible?
[2013-01-08 07:06:38] <Cosmo> also prime backwards
[2013-01-08 07:06:41] <leakhmskill> reverse them and they are still primes
[2013-01-08 07:06:42] <Flumentia_> Odd... the first onion's displaying the full cicada again.
[2013-01-08 07:06:49] <leakhmskill> outguess?
[2013-01-08 07:07:47] <lulzorz> Flumentia_: it has to do with the latency and speed of the tor network
[2013-01-08 07:07:54] <lulzorz> Flumentia_: it kills the connection when it sees an http request
[2013-01-08 07:07:56] <Flumentia_> Ah k
[2013-01-08 07:08:00] <perplexed_> welp, shazamming the song didn't work

[2013-01-08 07:08:23] <lulzorz> perplexed_: congrats, you are the 15th person to discover this
[2013-01-08 07:08:29] <perplexed_> oy lol
[2013-01-08 07:08:30] <lulzorz> perplexed_: maybe put it on the wiki or something?
[2013-01-08 07:08:47] <Grazza> i still dont get how soulseekah did that
[2013-01-08 07:09:16] <Cosmo> Can I just point out that Tab was fairly hastily put together. Not ever rhythmic pattern is copied because matching a finger picked playing style perfectly is insanely hard
[2013-01-08 07:09:55] <Flumentia_> lulzorz: I'm updating the "What we know" page gradually.
[2013-01-08 07:10:18] <perplexed_> is anyone working on what the final twitter line is?

[2013-01-08 07:12:47] <Flumentia_> Cool
[2013-01-08 07:12:54] <lulzorz> I suggest that people who solve these things publish methods, not solutions
[2013-01-08 07:13:10] <lulzorz> I mean, too many people having it already killed it
[2013-01-08 07:13:12] <Flumentia_> Well I think that this twitter message is a better idea than the mp3

[2013-01-08 07:13:49] <lulzorz> I mean it was working
[2013-01-08 07:13:52] <Cosmo> I'm going to delve a litte more into the history of these runes, see if anything jumps out

[2013-01-08 07:21:20] <Flumentia_> I'd say they bring something back soon.

[2013-01-08 07:30:09] <Flumentia_> I guess that may be why this one was taken down
[2013-01-08 07:30:39] <Flumentia_> Anyway, once I'm done with the documentation I'm going to work out this twitter message.
[2013-01-08 07:30:50] <JackHinds> it's hex right?
[2013-01-08 07:30:54] <Cosmo> If people knew too much last year, surely they'd just plan ahead this year?
[2013-01-08 07:31:57] <anon132> maybe they did.
[2013-01-08 07:33:51] <Flumentia_> They'd know we would collaborate. I'd say this year they'd try and link the individuals back to their IRC names and grant them access that way.

[2013-01-08 07:47:33] <n_factor> when you looked up the dns for that number.tk there was a txt entry for a web site
[2013-01-08 07:47:39] <n_factor> that web site had an image
[2013-01-08 07:47:57] <n_factor> there was some more book code and stuff
[2013-01-08 07:48:09] <n_factor> anyway, eventually it lead to the second chance onion
[2013-01-08 07:48:22] <n_factor> which was the same machine as the first chance, just on another onion address
[2013-01-08 07:48:44] <Flumentia_> Cool. So we may still have hope, but I reckon it was because ymgve doxed the first.
[2013-01-08 07:49:01] <n_factor> i assume it will come back online

[2013-01-08 07:50:37] <n_factor> i doxed the machine that was hosting the cicada pics server last year
[2013-01-08 07:50:45] <JackHinds> besides the data files from the iso
[2013-01-08 07:50:54] <n_factor> the address everyone was accessing was a proxy to the actual machine last year

[2013-01-08 07:53:13] <Flumentia_> We all know what they are...
[2013-01-08 07:53:39] <Flumentia_> Also I have found the best soundtrack for solving 3301: https://soundcloud.com/timeisup/sets/hacker-evolution-duality-game
[2013-01-08 07:54:14] <JackHinds> what are they?
[2013-01-08 07:55:11] <Flumentia_> At least I know what the first is. It was used to xor the image. Check that wiki page I posted
[2013-01-08 07:56:22] <Flumentia_> Reverse of the twitter code: http://pastebin.com/JUbMApwJ
[2013-01-08 07:59:34] <JackHinds> It has the word Parable in it, which has the number 761 in the middle of the number. There is reason to believe the other numbers in the "phone number" are important somehow. Someone will look into this.
[2013-01-08 07:59:38] <JackHinds> this is kinda incorrect
[2013-01-08 07:59:50] <artea> uh what?
[2013-01-08 08:00:08] <artea> what number
[2013-01-08 08:00:14] <Flumentia_> Can someone tell me how to xor on UNIX.
[2013-01-08 08:00:19] <JackHinds> 1,595,277,641
[2013-01-08 08:00:25] <JackHinds> there's no 761
[2013-01-08 08:00:37] <artea> thats been figured out
[2013-01-08 08:00:44] <artea> well
[2013-01-08 08:00:51] <Flumentia_> Has anyone tried calling that?

[2013-01-08 08:00:56] <artea> is the factors of the number
[2013-01-08 08:00:58] <n_factor> i'm going to bed
[2013-01-08 08:01:02] <artea> all 3 are prime reversible numbers
[2013-01-08 08:01:04] <artea> also
[2013-01-08 08:01:18] <artea> each one is a gematria number for each line in that parable
[2013-01-08 08:01:19] <n_factor> those factors are the "count" values of the lines of the parable

[2013-01-08 08:01:21] <artea> yes
[2013-01-08 08:01:28] <n_factor> and they are all reverse primes
[2013-01-08 08:01:37] <n_factor> meaning their reverse are primes as well
[2013-01-08 08:01:37] <artea> what to do with those numbers, i do not know
[2013-01-08 08:01:45] <artea> although i think the parable is a riddle
[2013-01-08 08:02:18] <n_factor> Patience is a virtue. comes out to 761
[2013-01-08 08:02:23] <n_factor> 167 is prime as well
[2013-01-08 08:02:42] <n_factor> seems 3301 likes this gematria game
[2013-01-08 08:02:45] <artea> anyone try the tree/forest line in the count yet
[2013-01-08 08:02:46] <JackHinds> did Ymgve xor all the data files from iso with mp3, tweets, pics etc?
[2013-01-08 08:03:29] <Flumentia_> He may have.
[2013-01-08 08:03:33] <n_factor> i was playing around with it today, and found "No man can serve two masters." is a reverse prime.
[2013-01-08 08:03:47] <Flumentia_> So no-one here knows how to xor on unix?
[2013-01-08 08:03:56] <n_factor> xor 2 files together?

[2013-01-08 08:10:02] <Cosmo> I'm interested in everything, s'what I do. But I'm not interested in winning. I'm interested in why cicada is so keen to hire the most intelligent people but keep everyone else in the dark.

[2013-01-08 08:10:11] <JackHinds> i guess that's the thread on 4chan i remember

[2013-01-08 08:13:33] <JackHinds> what do you suspect they do?
[2013-01-08 08:13:46] <Atlas_> Cosmo, to preserve the mystery about cicada, which is what gets people interested in the first place.
[2013-01-08 08:13:47] <Cosmo> Freedom of information isn't JUST letting people learn for themselves, it's trusting what they do what that knowledge, even if it means telling other people
[2013-01-08 08:13:52] <Lurker69> by making recruitment so hard they make sure that people who mede it in didnt tell jack shit to outsiders about what cicada is really doing
[2013-01-08 08:14:14] <Cosmo> If they wanted secrecy, they'd hire out of the military
[2013-01-08 08:14:25] <Lurker69> no

[2013-01-08 08:16:38] <Atlas_> Cosmo, there is no reason for us to believe that there is any kind of reward after being "recruited" by 3301. Their "elitist" behaviour is merely supposed to challenge those who dare to make use of their brain.
[2013-01-08 08:16:49] <Flumentia> Anonymity is a right, they're trying to stop crime. Albeit terribly.

[2013-01-08 08:23:16] <Cosmo> It feels like we've been told "If you go into this room and find what 'm looking for before all these people you've proven your intelligence." Wouldn't the smarter person ask why? =P Then again I say all this....But I'm still here. God damn you curiosity
[2013-01-08 08:23:21] <Flumentia> Read "what we know" on the wiki
[2013-01-08 08:23:28] <Flumentia> I've been documenting it
[2013-01-08 08:23:37] <soulseekah> Yes, I've read it, verifying things
[2013-01-08 08:23:42] <soulseekah> Offset	0, Skip: 0, Col: 65, Line: 988	Tue Jan 08 05:45:31 +0000 2013 is interesting
[2013-01-08 08:23:46] <Lurker69> anyway about unsolved puzzle from last year.... who is interested....?   i dont want to cause unnesecsary confusion in main chat so please i will show it to you in #cicada2012, kepp all of it there, i didnnt solve it to the end yet
[2013-01-08 08:23:59] <soulseekah> we still have the folly / wisdom files off the ramdisk
[2013-01-08 08:24:02] <scrounger> not sure if this relates, but it's kinda interesting: http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/xzdk1/cicadas_as_a_reality_check/

[2013-01-08 08:24:58] <Lurker69> no
[2013-01-08 08:25:14] <JackHinds> cicadas are cool viral campaign
[2013-01-08 08:25:19] <Lurker69> dont know whaat to do with that dsemiprime in final message, but it might be connected
[2013-01-08 08:25:43] <JackHinds> what's the final message?
[2013-01-08 08:25:44] <perplexed_> though its peculiar, really
[2013-01-08 08:25:53] <perplexed_> i spend so many days sitting on facebook with people i know
[2013-01-08 08:26:02] <Lurker69> Flumentia: got to #cicada2012
[2013-01-08 08:26:05] <perplexed_> in games with a teams that just cries at eachother
[2013-01-08 08:26:16] <perplexed_> and then this pops up and there's countless people working together talking discussing
[2013-01-08 08:26:49] <soulseekah> so both 2nd onion and linode have been down for the past 12 hours eh?
[2013-01-08 08:26:56] <Flumentia> Yep.
[2013-01-08 08:27:13] <Flumentia> We reckon there's a second chance somewhere. They've probably planned for it after last year.
[2013-01-08 08:29:04] <perplexed_> where was the wait til jan. 9th message displaeyd?
[2013-01-08 08:29:18] <Flumentia> Anyway, soulseekah, try and xor the reversed twitter message with something else.
[2013-01-08 08:29:29] <Flumentia> Last year
[2013-01-08 08:29:41] <soulseekah> how reversed?
[2013-01-08 08:29:46] <Flumentia> Jan 9 was when the onion page opened
[2013-01-08 08:29:50] <JackHinds> fun fact
[2013-01-08 08:29:56] <JackHinds> Uroko Onoja, a Nigerian polygamist businessman, died after being forced by five of his six wives to have sex with each of them. Onoja was caught having sex with his youngest wife by the remaining five, who were jealous of him paying her more attention. The remaining wives demanded that he also have sex with each of them, threatening him with knives and sticks. He had intercourse with four of them in succession, but stopped breath
[2013-01-08 08:30:00] <Cosmo> I'll be at the 9th of january in 16 and a half hours
[2013-01-08 08:30:37] <Flumentia> Try both the offsets in reverse order, then by each character
[2013-01-08 08:30:39] <pr0_> where is effy when you need him
[2013-01-08 08:30:40] <pr0_> .beer
[2013-01-08 08:31:26] <soulseekah> Flumentia, offsets into what? "lines" makes no sense so far, we have no piece of data with distinct lines in it, need something specific
[2013-01-08 08:32:00] <soulseekah> Last thing I was doing was xoring the folly/wisdom file yesterday
[2013-01-08 08:32:04] <Flumentia> Reverse as in 1234 = 4321
[2013-01-08 08:32:25] <Flumentia> They've been going on about palindromes, maybe it's relevant
[2013-01-08 08:32:52] <Flumentia> Also try xoring the forwards message with the other DATA files if you haven't yet.
[2013-01-08 08:33:06] <soulseekah> what forwards message?
[2013-01-08 08:34:04] <Flumentia> The twitter message.
[2013-01-08 08:34:27] <Flumentia> Like, all of the messages combined without the offsets

[2013-01-08 08:35:45] <Cosmo> Man i wish i could program shit. I'd build a translator. So if we got a message later using those runes, you could just copy it in and translate it
[2013-01-08 08:35:57] <Cosmo> Because they haven't been used THAT much yet
[2013-01-08 08:36:04] <Atlas_> Runes are easy as hell to read though, honestly.

[2013-01-08 08:45:13] <Lurker69> isnt gematria something that have to do with language
[2013-01-08 08:45:26] <Atlas_> http://www.odeion.org/gematria/gemchap-i.html
[2013-01-08 08:45:33] <Cosmo> (Although fun fact, the random hum matches the background noise of that sixstring guy's videos. It made me chuckle.)
[2013-01-08 08:45:37] <perplexed_> its the conversion from numbers to letters
[2013-01-08 08:45:46] <Lurker69> we have similar word in my language for "pronunciation" 
[2013-01-08 08:46:35] <Lurker69> http://www.gematrix.org/
[2013-01-08 08:46:37] <perplexed_> from my studies, the torah is a perfect reflection of nature and why it was deemed to be written by god
[2013-01-08 08:46:59] <perplexed_> and so all the codes that were transcribed in it were taken with significance
[2013-01-08 08:48:35] <perplexed_> the entire language becomes one giant web of perpetual knowledge
[2013-01-08 08:50:15] <scrounger> so, perplexed_ what do you think of this? this seems to be an english-language gematria
[2013-01-08 08:51:01] <perplexed_> they based it off prime numbers and the book of law
[2013-01-08 08:51:26] <artea> yeah, the english gematria on that site is not the same
[2013-01-08 08:51:31] <scrounger> well, yes...  but I mean, you seem more familiar with gematria than anyone else in here.
[2013-01-08 08:51:36] <Cosmo> I was looking into the history of these runes and languages, they seem to all be about connectivity to nature and what's 'all around us'
[2013-01-08 08:51:49] <perplexed_> all you mean how it plays into the code?
[2013-01-08 08:52:47] <anon132> which makes sense since "the key is all around you"

[2013-01-08 09:09:35] <Flumentia> OK gemiatria is creepy
[2013-01-08 09:10:08] <perplexed> i really don't understand whats so scary about gematria
[2013-01-08 09:10:08] <scrounger> gematria keeps getting creepier too
[2013-01-08 09:11:58] <pr0_> its magick
[2013-01-08 09:13:26] <anon132> its just geometry scrounger
[2013-01-08 09:13:42] <scrounger> no it's not
[2013-01-08 09:13:49] <scrounger> it has nothing to od with geometry
[2013-01-08 09:14:03] <scrounger> perplexed: you grew up with gematria. we didn't
[2013-01-08 09:15:01] <perplexed> but its just converting letters and numbers into eachother
[2013-01-08 09:15:14] <perplexed> its really cool but i don't see how its creepy
[2013-01-08 09:15:28] <artea> yes but when you start seeing the coincidences when you start researching/experimenting with it
[2013-01-08 09:15:40] <Absence_> Isnt there a belief that some words have equal value to another word
[2013-01-08 09:15:52] <perplexed> ah yeah it does get creepy in that sense
[2013-01-08 09:15:57] <perplexed> its not a belief
[2013-01-08 09:16:00] <perplexed> pick a number
[2013-01-08 09:16:31] <artea> for instance perplexed, i had my hand cut open on glass, and got 14 stitches, 14 = hand in gematria
[2013-01-08 09:16:55] <Tech1_Phone> Coincidence
[2013-01-08 09:17:03] <artea> yes coincidence
[2013-01-08 09:17:05] <perplexed> watch the whole movie Pi, it'll blow your mind
[2013-01-08 09:17:08] <Absence_> ahh wiki says it right
[2013-01-08 09:17:10] <Absence_> " in the belief that words or phrases with identical numerical values bear some relation to each other"

[2013-01-08 09:19:50] <perplexed> i only trust the hebrew gematria though
[2013-01-08 09:20:06] <artea> i agree
[2013-01-08 09:20:23] <perplexed> it was safeguarded and kept holy and sacred for its purity

[2013-01-08 09:22:45] <perplexed> this site is incomplete, but it can be used general for basic gematria
[2013-01-08 09:24:23] <perplexed> so if you have the word A, you convert it into gematria, and then you can interchange it with another word of equal value
[2013-01-08 09:25:01] <perplexed> though this is all sidetracked since they're using the runic system in the cypher

[2013-01-08 09:29:31] <Cosmo> Just because.... Well look at how many of the letters have the meaning as a type of tree here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_runes

[2013-01-08 10:02:14] <Tech1-Phone> The messages are signed like 3301 is a person, makes sense
[2013-01-08 10:03:04] <Cosmo> That's what I was thinking. Imagine cicada is a company, but when 'hiring' is to happen it's someone's job to oversee it. It would explain how things seem to change like we're being watched

[2013-01-08 10:03:45] <scrounger> wait, what last clue?
[2013-01-08 10:03:51] <Grazza> was the hint thing discovered after they took down onion 2?

[2013-01-08 10:05:20] <soulseekah> is what we're assuming

[2013-01-08 10:11:36] <scrounger> supposedly, they sent out a different message to each person. there were slight differences so that if one got leaked then they would know who leaked it

[2013-01-08 10:17:47] <scrounger> Ymgve, I agree..  but they don't seem like an actual cult. I mean, cults get people to worship one person right? this thing says they claim that each person is their own god or some shit
[2013-01-08 10:17:50] <Cosmo> But they don't recruit more smart people, they recruit the weak minded

[2013-01-08 10:18:59] <Absence_>  I don't believe they would try to sheer people into a cult by multiple puzzles and challenges. Normally you would look for possiblt cultists in real life, keeping it hush-hush from the internet.
[2013-01-08 10:19:25] <perplexed> cults aren't necessarily for the weak minded. there can be a cult of intelligents

[2013-01-08 10:21:01] <scrounger> Zarathustra ties the Übermensch to the death of God. While this God was the ultimate expression of other-worldly values and the instincts that gave birth to those values, belief in that God nevertheless did give meaning to life for a time. 'God is dead' means that the idea of God can no longer provide values. With the sole source of values no longer capable of providing those values, there is a real chance of nihili
[2013-01-08 10:21:02] <scrounger> sm prevailing.
[2013-01-08 10:21:02] <scrounger> Zarathustra presents the Übermensch as the creator of new values. In this way, it appears as a solution to the problem of the death of God and nihilism. If the Übermensch acts to create new values within the moral vacuum of nihilism, there is nothing that this creative act would not justify. Alternatively, in the absence of this creation, there are no grounds upon which to criticize or justify any action, including
[2013-01-08 10:21:04] <scrounger>  the particular values created and the means by which they are promulgated.
[2013-01-08 10:21:14] <scrounger> (from wikipedia)
[2013-01-08 10:23:28] <Cosmo> If they hold the belief that we are all, as in we are what there is, no god, now afterlife, it ties in with love of the earth

[2013-01-08 10:26:57] <chimp-> maybe its just a thematic motif they use
[2013-01-08 10:27:06] <chimp-> making all of their clues prime related
[2013-01-08 10:27:09] <scrounger> that's not even thelemic. that's william blake
[2013-01-08 10:27:25] <Cosmo> We don't know that they choose words because of their number, or they kept finding the number IN the words
[2013-01-08 10:27:27] <scrounger> in fact, no crowley or thelema last year at all.
[2013-01-08 10:27:29] <Absence_> What was the last available thing to a public? The email section? (for last year). I saw a picture that had a PGP signature and I saw that someone had to put an email in
[2013-01-08 10:27:47] <chimp-> cosmo they arbitrarily assign value to letters in the rune table
[2013-01-08 10:27:48] <scrounger> not sure
[2013-01-08 10:27:54] <chimp-> each count is just an addition of numbers i nthe word
[2013-01-08 10:28:17] <scrounger> chimp: doesn't look arbitrary. they took the first 29 prime numbers, and assigned them to letter combinations based on the order from the anglo-saxon runes
[2013-01-08 10:28:37] <scrounger> pretty much the opposite of arbitrary
[2013-01-08 10:28:42] <chimp-> well not arbitrary then,
[2013-01-08 10:29:00] <chimp-> but its not pure conincidence all of these phrases and what not come up as primes when counted
[2013-01-08 10:29:02] <scrounger> but, guys, that william blake poem is hundreds of years old.
[2013-01-08 10:29:06] <Cosmo> Alright so as we don't know what to do next, maybe we try working out why everything comes back to nature and shit?
[2013-01-08 10:29:29] <scrounger> all the crowley shit is like 200 years old too
[2013-01-08 10:29:37] <perplexed> because we are nature
[2013-01-08 10:29:38] <Cosmo> Cant see the forest for the trees, the answer is all around us, the ubermensch thing about the earth
[2013-01-08 10:29:39] <scrounger> everything is super fucking old, in fact.
[2013-01-08 10:30:14] <scrounger> they come up with art and literature and poems from ages ago, and this number shit still works. fucking weird.
[2013-01-08 10:30:17] <Cosmo> So here's me speculating. They are a group driven by the ideal that what we are now is all we have and all that is.
[2013-01-08 10:30:31] <chimp-> scrounger id be wary about assigning too much value to counting phrases adn getting a prime
[2013-01-08 10:30:35] <chimp-> especially for low value counts
[2013-01-08 10:30:37] <perplexed> scrounger, they were the true masters of it
[2013-01-08 10:30:53] <scrounger> anybody have any ideas about what the poem means?
[2013-01-08 10:30:53] <chimp-> count chimp scrounger
[2013-01-08 10:31:03] <artea> chimp, not only primes, but reversible primes
[2013-01-08 10:31:14] <scrounger> yeah, it's the reversible primes though
[2013-01-08 10:31:16] <scrounger> every time
[2013-01-08 10:31:19] <Atlas_> Fibonacci numbers are everywhere... in nature...
[2013-01-08 10:31:21] <chimp-> not every time but yeah mostly
[2013-01-08 10:31:29] <chimp-> but how many primes are reveresible in the under 200 range?
[2013-01-08 10:31:42] <chimp-> i dont have my list of counted phrases,
[2013-01-08 10:31:44] <scrounger> right. the one phrase isn't even prime
[2013-01-08 10:31:47] <chimp-> but most were quite low in number
[2013-01-08 10:31:58] <scrounger> count There is no salvation in life; For there is nothing from which we must be saved.

[2013-01-08 10:36:16] <chimp-> the counting program
[2013-01-08 10:36:21] <chimp-> what do we know it does?

[2013-01-08 10:36:54] <soulseekah> and counts gemantria
[2013-01-08 10:37:29] <chimp-> calculates prime factors by counting each letters value from a value off the rune table right?
[2013-01-08 10:37:37] <Lurker69> also posting again i updated wiki abit http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/Twitter_is_jpg_theory#TOR_2_PAGE_IS_DOWN

[2013-01-08 10:38:14] <soulseekah> perplexed, phrases words yes

[2013-01-08 10:43:43] <chimp-> freidnlygiant - invalid, it cuonts letters
[2013-01-08 10:43:44] <chimp-> not numbers
[2013-01-08 10:43:48] <perplexed> thanks
[2013-01-08 10:43:56] <soulseekah> count trees - 257+, count forest - 199*
[2013-01-08 10:44:17] <Atlas_> count Like the instar, tunneling to the surface ?
[2013-01-08 10:44:24] <artea> * means reversible, + means regular prime?
[2013-01-08 10:44:25] <artea> or what
[2013-01-08 10:44:26] <chimp-> each line of that is prime
[2013-01-08 10:44:28] <chimp-> yes artea
[2013-01-08 10:44:32] <rb33333> good good, sorry, just got into work and back onto this, whats happened over the last 8 hours? last thing i was with was the "rune table count" connection
[2013-01-08 10:44:34] <soulseekah> yes
[2013-01-08 10:44:46] <chimp-> soulseekah going back to where we were
[2013-01-08 10:44:54] <chimp-> why do you think the program does that
[2013-01-08 10:45:29] <Cosmo> Well it either wants to show you something, or hint at you to do something
[2013-01-08 10:45:36] <artea> well, that parable poem multiplied (*) the 3 reversible primes
[2013-01-08 10:45:47] <soulseekah> or it's just a handy tool for soemthing we alreayd have
[2013-01-08 10:45:52] <soulseekah> or will maybe get
[2013-01-08 10:46:11] <soulseekah> or it's expecting us to enter something magical
[2013-01-08 10:46:21] <rb33333> if you type in primes you get a list of primes similar to the OS program
[2013-01-08 10:46:28] <artea> did u try abrahadabra? XD
[2013-01-08 10:46:29] <rb33333> except its missing a huge chunk in the middle
[2013-01-08 10:46:46] <chimp-> count the instar line is  1259*, yet entering 1259 simply returns "+"
[2013-01-08 10:46:50] <Cosmo> really?
[2013-01-08 10:46:52] <chimp-> which it does for many of the found primes
[2013-01-08 10:46:54] <chimp-> but not all
[2013-01-08 10:47:14] <chimp-> so what is the significance there
[2013-01-08 10:47:15] <Cosmo> those missing primes, are they all consecutive? or does it miss sections?
[2013-01-08 10:47:15] <soulseekah> the meanings of * an + are different for the number command and the count command
[2013-01-08 10:47:36] <rb33333> it missed out a section
[2013-01-08 10:47:45] <chimp-> what do they mean for the number command?
[2013-01-08 10:47:54] <rb33333> 1 second, im just waking up, havnt even had a coffee yet
[2013-01-08 10:48:23] <rb33333> if you type in primes, you get all the primes from 2 to 3301, but theres a gap where it jumps from 71 to 1229
[2013-01-08 10:48:38] <rb33333> it doesnt do that in the bootable os
[2013-01-08 10:48:46] <chimp-> where are you doing that rb
[2013-01-08 10:48:46] <soulseekah> rb33333, good find
[2013-01-08 10:48:49] <chimp-> in the count program?
[2013-01-08 10:48:49] <rb33333> it has all the primes from 2 to 3301
[2013-01-08 10:48:51] <soulseekah> I didn't know about the primes command
[2013-01-08 10:49:00] <rb33333> in the telnet

[2013-01-08 10:49:15] <rb33333> yeah, see the gap
[2013-01-08 10:49:15] <soulseekah> also note the double spaces
[2013-01-08 10:49:16] <chimp-> ah i see , got it
[2013-01-08 10:49:53] <chimp-> the ga between 29 and 31 for ex?
[2013-01-08 10:50:06] <Atlas_> Many of the significant "keywords" (cicada, poem lines) return a prime that, if entered again, returns +
[2013-01-08 10:50:16] <Atlas_> Anyone else thinks that should lead us somewhere?
[2013-01-08 10:50:21] <chimp-> maybe atlas
[2013-01-08 10:50:24] <chimp-> not all of them do
[2013-01-08 10:50:30] <chimp-> which must be significant
[2013-01-08 10:50:32] <iIIustrious> alot of the related words give +, not just numbers
[2013-01-08 10:50:42] <Atlas_> Yeah
[2013-01-08 10:51:02] <Atlas_> What was it that returned 2 2 2 2 again?
[2013-01-08 10:51:06] <chimp-> what if we are meant to build a sentence by adding the words that return +
[2013-01-08 10:51:14] <chimp-> based on their value in ascending order
[2013-01-08 10:51:15] <chimp-> or something
[2013-01-08 10:51:32] <Absence_> http://prntscr.com/ohzkh
[2013-01-08 10:51:34] <Absence_> which one of those is debian 6 64-bit
[2013-01-08 10:51:35] <Absence_> ..
[2013-01-08 10:52:14] <Cosmo> chimp maybe, but do you think there are any words that when the number is re-entered will return *?
[2013-01-08 10:52:29] <chimp-> ive not found any numbers that return * i dont think
[2013-01-08 10:52:31] <soulseekah> adacic also returns +
[2013-01-08 10:52:39] <soulseekah> what number returns a *?
[2013-01-08 10:52:41] <chimp-> only +, or their factors , or their factors of the reverse value of the entered prime
[2013-01-08 10:53:13] <perplexed> soulseekah i get this : nc: getaddrinfo: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
[2013-01-08 10:53:55] <chimp-> what if
[2013-01-08 10:54:03] <chimp-> what if the hint doesnt refer to the entire puzzl
[2013-01-08 10:54:06] <chimp-> but is specific to onion 1
[2013-01-08 10:54:06] <soulseekah> perplexed, paste your command
[2013-01-08 10:54:07] <chimp-> and the obvious hint
[2013-01-08 10:54:09] <chimp-> you get from hello ?
[2013-01-08 10:54:14] <chimp-> you cant see the forest for the trees
[2013-01-08 10:54:21] <chimp-> you cant see the other clues because we are so busy focused on the main one
[2013-01-08 10:54:25] <chimp-> that hexdump
[2013-01-08 10:54:29] <perplexed> nc -x localhost:[17500] emiwp4muu2ktwknf.onion 80
[2013-01-08 10:54:38] <soulseekah> perplexed, no [] in port
[2013-01-08 10:54:46] <soulseekah> just localhost:17500
[2013-01-08 10:55:01] <soulseekah> I put brackets to show you that torport is not a literal
[2013-01-08 10:55:10] <perplexed> ah understood
[2013-01-08 10:55:29] <perplexed> now tis...strange
[2013-01-08 10:55:33] <Cosmo> So what should we be focused on? I said something very similar
[2013-01-08 10:56:04] <chimp-> well maybe we have missed something in onion 1
[2013-01-08 10:56:15] <chimp-> i mean the clue is gives is so obvious, the hex dump
[2013-01-08 10:56:24] <chimp-> its thrown in our faces as soon as we telnet in
[2013-01-08 10:56:29] <perplexed> i don't get a prompt screen now
[2013-01-08 10:56:39] <soulseekah> perplexed, did you get the cicada?
[2013-01-08 10:56:44] <perplexed> no
[2013-01-08 10:56:53] <soulseekah> no errors?
[2013-01-08 10:57:11] <soulseekah> so wait a bit, maybe a laggy connection
[2013-01-08 10:57:21] <perplexed> ah just popped up
[2013-01-08 10:57:23] <soulseekah> chimp-, that is true, it's too easy
[2013-01-08 10:57:24] <perplexed> broken pipe
[2013-01-08 10:57:33] <iIIustrious> it can be slow, tor is unreliable in that
[2013-01-08 10:57:35] <perplexed> port range not valid
[2013-01-08 10:57:38] <soulseekah> perplexed, try again, it's tor after all
[2013-01-08 10:57:54] <soulseekah> perplexed, port range? paste your lie
[2013-01-08 10:57:57] <chimp-> i mean i found the hex dump difficult because i had never seen a hex dump before
[2013-01-08 10:57:58] <soulseekah> s/lie/line
[2013-01-08 10:58:04] <chimp-> but most of the programmer types here cracked it in like 3 seconds
[2013-01-08 10:58:13] <soulseekah> chimp-, but compared to the "hint" dump where we needed to xor
[2013-01-08 10:58:15] <chimp-> and i did it more laboriously and slower but even i got it
[2013-01-08 10:58:18] <soulseekah> the "hello" dump is too easy
[2013-01-08 10:58:37] <chimp-> yeah agreed
[2013-01-08 10:58:50] <perplexed> nc: read failed (0/3): Broken pipe
[2013-01-08 10:58:50] <soulseekah> as if it itself had some other purpose
[2013-01-08 10:58:59] <perplexed> nc: port range not valid
[2013-01-08 10:59:05] <chimp-> what is even the point of including the count program
[2013-01-08 10:59:06] <soulseekah> perplexed, paste your line again
[2013-01-08 10:59:15] <chimp-> its useless in the context of getting th hello dump
[2013-01-08 10:59:16] <perplexed> in here or in terminal?
[2013-01-08 10:59:23] <chimp-> yet its still there

[2013-01-08 10:59:56] <soulseekah> perplexed, type nc -h do you have the -x flag?
[2013-01-08 11:00:03] <perplexed> -x flag?
[2013-01-08 11:00:05] <soulseekah> is your -x flag the proxy flag?
[2013-01-08 11:00:19] <soulseekah> on mac -x is something else I think

[2013-01-08 11:00:38] <soulseekah> nope on my mac -x is proxy:port
[2013-01-08 11:00:43] <soulseekah> hmm
[2013-01-08 11:01:29] <soulseekah> try the -D flag for debug see what it says
[2013-01-08 11:01:31] <perplexed> oh wait

[2013-01-08 11:01:44] <perplexed> bad port
[2013-01-08 11:02:07] <chimp-> that hexdump...did it say anything else
[2013-01-08 11:02:14] <chimp-> it said well done or something, and had the .onion address
[2013-01-08 11:02:15] <soulseekah> chimp- yes
[2013-01-08 11:02:43] <soulseekah> Offset: 3301
[2013-01-08 11:03:00] <soulseekah> which points to an offset in one of the data files

[2013-01-08 11:03:39] <soulseekah> on the iso yes
[2013-01-08 11:03:57] <soulseekah> + we have the folly/wisdom files from the ramdisk of the iso boot

[2013-01-08 11:12:18] <chimp-> is that a hexdump of thefolly data?
[2013-01-08 11:12:28] <soulseekah> no, those are folly/wisdom files from the iso

[2013-01-08 11:12:36] <Tech1> i miss anything while my phone was being stupi?
[2013-01-08 11:12:38] <Lurker69> folly name was used last year in few messages IIRC
[2013-01-08 11:12:53] <soulseekah> both are identical so
[2013-01-08 11:13:00] <Absence_> works
[2013-01-08 11:13:01] <Absence_> lol
[2013-01-08 11:13:02] <soulseekah> chimp-, yes
[2013-01-08 11:13:03] =-= Tech1 is now known as Tech1_Phone
[2013-01-08 11:13:22] <chimp-> so they both just contain garbled ascii..
[2013-01-08 11:13:26] <perplexed> they're the same but they're opposites
[2013-01-08 11:13:29] <soulseekah> binary data
[2013-01-08 11:13:31] <soulseekah> yes
[2013-01-08 11:13:33] <rb33333> right, not being someone who can read machine code, could you not apply the offset to this data file?
[2013-01-08 11:13:33] <Lurker69> folly/wisdom files?   where are they from?   cicada OS  or hidden somwere else?
[2013-01-08 11:13:56] <soulseekah> Lurker69, in /tmp
[2013-01-08 11:14:05] <rb33333> and could the offset be the number you get when you pump in the name "folly" or "wisdom" into the telnet?
[2013-01-08 11:14:06] <Lurker69> thx
[2013-01-08 11:14:13] <rb33333> ie, 258 or 270
[2013-01-08 11:14:27] <chimp-> what is an offset anyway
[2013-01-08 11:14:30] <Lurker69> soulseekah: important enough to post in wiki?
[2013-01-08 11:14:31] <soulseekah> rb33333, there are millions of possibilites
[2013-01-08 11:14:36] <soulseekah> Lurker69, of course
[2013-01-08 11:14:43] <soulseekah> as important as the a files
[2013-01-08 11:14:48] <soulseekah> DATA files, I mean
[2013-01-08 11:14:58] <Lurker69> dump them to mediafire or dropbox, so i can link them
[2013-01-08 11:15:02] <soulseekah> and the mp3, this will definitely be used to xor something with something
[2013-01-08 11:15:25] <soulseekah> doesn't the wiki allow uploads?
[2013-01-08 11:15:36] <rb33333> soulseekah, there are, but trying 258 for folly or 270 for wisdom makes some logical sense
[2013-01-08 11:15:47] <rb33333> seeing as thats the output when you put folly into the telnet
[2013-01-08 11:15:47] <soulseekah> what would one do with those?
[2013-01-08 11:15:57] <soulseekah> that's the expected output
[2013-01-08 11:16:00] <soulseekah> according to the table
[2013-01-08 11:16:30] <soulseekah> offsets are key of course, but the only definite offset we have is 3301 from the "hello" message
[2013-01-08 11:16:44] <soulseekah> which is an offset to a section in one of hte data files
[2013-01-08 11:17:00] <chimp-> what about that data file, what is in that?
[2013-01-08 11:17:05] =-= rb33333 is now known as rb9269
[2013-01-08 11:17:05] <soulseekah> but remember an offset is just that - an offset a position within some data
[2013-01-08 11:17:17] <soulseekah> chimp-, same old binary
[2013-01-08 11:17:38] <chimp-> same as in the exact same to folly and wisdom ?
[2013-01-08 11:17:43] <chimp-> or just meaningless binary
[2013-01-08 11:17:44] <soulseekah> nothing plain for now, although for example DATA/_560.00 at offset 0 has been used already
[2013-01-08 11:17:54] <soulseekah> to xor with the "hint"/"clue" dump
[2013-01-08 11:18:07] <Lurker69> soulseekah: you are right, dumps are enough, what are exact name of the files folly and wisdom?  no extension?
[2013-01-08 11:18:10] <soulseekah> but the dump is small compared to the key data, so
[2013-01-08 11:18:20] <soulseekah> it is quite possible that after use we have to offset the key
[2013-01-08 11:18:34] <soulseekah> and use it with an offset on other data, but many of the offsets have been tried already
[2013-01-08 11:18:51] <Ymgve> soulseekah: though, nothing stops it from being used again
[2013-01-08 11:18:59] <soulseekah> nothing
[2013-01-08 11:19:16] <perplexed> try 270 for folly and 258 for wisdom
[2013-01-08 11:19:20] <soulseekah> but I'm sure everyone tried everything with offset 0
[2013-01-08 11:19:59] <soulseekah> also there's the reversing of data and applying it, or reverse + offset
[2013-01-08 11:20:19] <rb9269> perplexed, thats what im trying to say, since thats what telnet gives as a count for each
[2013-01-08 11:20:41] <perplexed> rb9269 its probably been tried already. i switched them though
[2013-01-08 11:20:51] <perplexed> the words are opposites of eachother, yet the files are identical
[2013-01-08 11:21:06] <soulseekah> rb9269, perplexed count is given for everything

[2013-01-08 11:21:35] <chimp-> the offset just tells you to go to a particular place within the file right?

[2013-01-08 11:21:49] <soulseekah> in many cases, chimp-, yes
[2013-01-08 11:22:00] <soulseekah> Lurker69, they have been found ages ago

[2013-01-08 11:26:47] <chimp-> sorry i meant hello
[2013-01-08 11:26:54] <chimp-> hello had the onion, and offset 3301
[2013-01-08 11:27:02] <chimp-> in the hexdump
[2013-01-08 11:27:06] <chimp-> correct?
[2013-01-08 11:27:07] <soulseekah> so we have to xor hello with one of the files at offset 3301
[2013-01-08 11:27:17] <Ymgve> in theory
[2013-01-08 11:27:26] <chimp-> how do you know what file offset 3301 points to

[2013-01-08 11:27:32] <Ymgve> you don't
[2013-01-08 11:28:00] <chimp-> hmm
[2013-01-08 11:28:05] <Ymgve> one funny idea is that we should xor with the iso itself, since that area is full of 00s it just returns the same message
[2013-01-08 11:28:25] <soulseekah> interesting
[2013-01-08 11:29:05] <Ymgve> that's one way to explain that the message is in plaintext while at the same time it is in the xor format
[2013-01-08 11:29:15] <soulseekah> agreed
[2013-01-08 11:29:23] <chimp-> which message

[2013-01-08 11:49:47] <Lurker69> ^^ interesting
[2013-01-08 11:49:52] <lull> and its connected to wroley
[2013-01-08 11:50:00] <lull> croley
[2013-01-08 11:50:04] <lull> crowley*
[2013-01-08 11:50:09] <chimp-> what if..what if patience is a virtue isnt meant to mean we have to wait
[2013-01-08 11:50:13] <chimp-> what if that is the clue
[2013-01-08 11:50:22] <lull> i m thinking the smae
[2013-01-08 11:50:32] <chimp-> but then what does it mean..we make the two files fight each other pokemon style?
[2013-01-08 11:50:42] <Cosmo> Cosmo the god is a badass, but no i'm not him.
[2013-01-08 11:51:02] <Tech1_Phone> youd be in violation of parole, if you were.
[2013-01-08 11:51:09] <Tech1_Phone> and also 15.
[2013-01-08 11:51:21] <Tech1_Phone> and also in NYC, which your not
[2013-01-08 11:51:52] <Cosmo> He also got done for acting like someone else though ;) Hahaha!
[2013-01-08 11:51:54] <chimp-> we have been xoring everything with a key obtained from the mp3 file right ?
[2013-01-08 11:52:15] <Lurker69> it is posible that onionp ages we have are just red herrings...   there might be  another thing we  missed, doxing second onion was way to easy
[2013-01-08 11:52:29] <Tech1_Phone> haha, ya never know. I personally dont think he hacked the @dearshirley twitter. I dont think hes that dumb
[2013-01-08 11:52:52] <chimp-> yeah lurker we were thinking that
[2013-01-08 11:53:01] <Tech1_Phone> i think it was mis-/dis-info. Oddly though, the @ug twitter did come back during the hack.
[2013-01-08 11:53:04] <chimp-> you cant see the forest for the trees
[2013-01-08 11:53:14] <chimp-> cant see the real clueb ecause of the phony one
[2013-01-08 11:53:25] <chimp-> well not phony, but not the main one
[2013-01-08 11:53:39] <Cosmo> This is part of what i was asking earlier
[2013-01-08 11:53:55] <Lurker69> also have you noticeed empty spaced in Forest message?
[2013-01-08 11:53:59] <Cosmo> I'm sure we've missed something
[2013-01-08 11:53:59] <Lurker69> 2 3 5 3 2
[2013-01-08 11:54:09] <Lurker69> every empty line has few spaces
[2013-01-08 11:54:31] <Lurker69> https://pastee.org/2zae9
[2013-01-08 11:54:37] <Lurker69> select and count them
[2013-01-08 11:55:27] <Tech1_Phone> I think you guys may be digging in too deep. All of the previous clues were obvious, or obscured by xor. Analyzing lines from a 200 year old poem? Dont think it'll get us anywhere.
[2013-01-08 11:55:38] <Tech1_Phone> obvious is a relative term
[2013-01-08 11:55:46] <Cosmo> oh yeah no one told me
[2013-01-08 11:55:56] <Cosmo> 761, the title of the mp3
[2013-01-08 11:56:02] <Lurker69> http://imgur.com/4xJAS   it is pascale triangle with prime numbers, dont know if it has special name   ALSO THIS IMAGE IS FROM LAST YEAR AND I BELIEVE IT EAS MADE BY TROLLS
[2013-01-08 11:56:03] <Cosmo> ....it ever become important again?
[2013-01-08 11:56:09] <Tech1_Phone> so, in conclusion, i think we missed something, or they didnt release the next clue. Or i'm retarded.

[2013-01-08 12:04:37] <soulseekah> best to compile from source
[2013-01-08 12:04:47] <Tech1_Phone> ^
[2013-01-08 12:05:14] <Absence_> i'm using Matriux Krypton (debian 64 bit)
[2013-01-08 12:06:02] <Cooper5> Speaking of compiling from source, someone linked me to a C program for xoring stuff but it was just the source. I tried running it through gcc but I couldn't get it to work. How exactly do I compile it?
[2013-01-08 12:07:04] <soulseekah> where's the source?
[2013-01-08 12:07:19] <soulseekah> and what exactly didn't work?
[2013-01-08 12:07:23] <Cooper5> Hang on they linked it to me in a paste that I copied into a text document.
[2013-01-08 12:07:35] <soulseekah> any errors while compiling or anything
[2013-01-08 12:08:04] <Cooper5> Let me try again and I'll tell you what it returned. I'm sure I was just putting in the commands wrong or something.
[2013-01-08 12:08:15] <Cooper5> I've never compiled anything from source before.

[2013-01-08 12:31:51] <Cooper5> Maybe we've been going faster than they expected so they're trying to slow us down to make time for getting things ready in the physical world?
[2013-01-08 12:32:05] <chimp-> especially since ymgve cracked the twitter puzzle early

[2013-01-08 13:09:41] <chimp-> not sure if thats really related though

[2013-01-08 13:09:50] <crash_demons> ok
[2013-01-08 13:09:54] <rb9269> crash, yeah im sure theres a proverb or saying somewhere about theres a little folly in wisdom and a little wisdom in folly
[2013-01-08 13:10:32] <chimp-> sure its not wisdom in little folly and folly in little wisdom, has a better ring to it :p

[2013-01-08 13:12:17] <chimp-> yeah thats probably what plato said
[2013-01-08 13:12:33] <scrounger> ok, here's something: "So I thought to myself, The fate of the fool will happen even to me! Then what did I gain by becoming so excessively wise? So I lamented to myself, The benefits of wisdom are ultimately meaningless! "
[2013-01-08 13:13:10] <crash_demons> taken literally, while the content may be otherwise useful, you might look at how far the files are offset apart in the filesystem, whats between them, whats around them. etc

[2013-01-08 13:15:25] <NikTitanik> guys, is there a pastebin of all the twitter posts stuck together?
[2013-01-08 13:15:43] <rb9269> the first line saying Parable 1,595,277,641
[2013-01-08 13:15:44] <scrounger> So I loathed life because what happens on earth seems awful to me; for all the benefits of wisdom are futile  like chasing the wind.
[2013-01-08 13:15:58] <Grazza> scrounger what is that from?
[2013-01-08 13:16:02] <rb9269> A parable is a succinct story, in prose or verse,
[2013-01-08 13:16:18] <scrounger> it's from the link i posted a minute ago
[2013-01-08 13:16:28] <rb9269> and the book of wisdom or folly is written in verses
[2013-01-08 13:16:40] <Grazza> ok
[2013-01-08 13:16:41] <scrounger> Wisdom vs Folly according to Solomon in the BIble: http://bible.org/seriespage/wisdom-vs-folly

[2013-01-08 13:16:53] <scrounger> apparently, Solomon says they both end up the same

[2013-01-08 13:18:51] <Cooper5> Is that one all of them?
[2013-01-08 13:18:52] <rb9269> im just looking at the symbols written on the book
[2013-01-08 13:19:23] <rb9269> because each verse has a symbol, alpha, beta, gamma delta ect

[2013-01-08 13:21:19] <soulseekah> is the number of the parable a prime?
[2013-01-08 13:21:37] <soulseekah> although it should matter, does it have any significance at all?
[2013-01-08 13:21:49] <soulseekah> or could it be considered a 1.5MB offset into one of the files?
[2013-01-08 13:22:15] <Grazza> i think someone said that the large number was simply the count of each line multiplied
[2013-01-08 13:22:25] <rb9269> no, the parables are 1, 595, 277, and 641 none of which are primes
[2013-01-08 13:23:06] <scrounger> rb: no, that's not it
[2013-01-08 13:23:19] <rb9269> ...?
[2013-01-08 13:23:20] <Lurker69> hmm
[2013-01-08 13:23:23] <scrounger> if you take the count of each line and multiply them together, you get the parable number
[2013-01-08 13:23:30] <scrounger> each line is prime forwards and backwards

[2013-01-08 13:34:11] <crash_demons> Cooper5, only on extract mode, or also on Scan mode?  when I try Scan with invalid files, it seems to do okay
[2013-01-08 13:34:26] <Cooper5> I haven't tried to scan.
[2013-01-08 13:34:55] * crash_demons thinks this is going to boil down to Why ArgC  (argument count) is 6 when he only supplied 5 arguments.
[2013-01-08 13:35:03] <Cooper5> Anyway, to be sure that it works, what are two files I could xor together to be guaranteed a proper result?
[2013-01-08 13:35:30] <crash_demons> they wouldn't be related to this ARG, but any of the files mentioned in the help text
[2013-01-08 13:35:32] <Cooper5> None of the ones I've tried xoring together have given me any proper text or images.
[2013-01-08 13:35:39] <Lurker69> disregard darkest puzzle

[2013-01-08 13:43:19] <crash_demons> the documentation doesn't explain the point that you hit, and in XOR "messagefile" and "keyfile" are ambiguous

[2013-01-08 13:48:39] <Grazza> what are drops?
[2013-01-08 13:49:05] <Tech1_Phone> Lurker: what the actual fuck. That is awesome.
[2013-01-08 13:49:59] <Cooper5> drops are locations used to transfer physics objects between people without the people needing to meet face to face.
[2013-01-08 13:50:08] <Cooper5> Typically called dead drops.
[2013-01-08 13:50:15] <Grazza> cool
[2013-01-08 13:50:28] <Cooper5> Kinda like post boxes. But hidden.
[2013-01-08 13:50:43] <Grazza> so they give you an address or what?
[2013-01-08 13:50:44] <Tech1_Phone> And generally only used in espionage. Haha
[2013-01-08 13:51:25] <Cooper5> Lets say if two people need to share some kind of information but the two people meeting face to face would raise suspicion. I could sit at a table at an outdoor cafe and stick a CD to the bottom of a table with gum and finsih eating and leave.
[2013-01-08 13:52:29] <Cooper5> Nobody else knows that CD is there except for the intended recipient. They could go to the cafe later that day or another day and sit at the same table, grabbing the CD without even looking under the table, or making it look like they dropped something and grabbing it when they go under the table.
[2013-01-08 13:52:42] <Grazza> got it
[2013-01-08 13:52:49] <Cooper5> Dead drops were used last year with posters.
[2013-01-08 13:53:02] <Grazza> so you need really detailed instructions then
[2013-01-08 13:53:03] <Cooper5> Posters were placed around the workd with QR codes on them
[2013-01-08 13:53:24] <Cooper5> Either really detailed instructions, or you really need to know what you're looking for.
[2013-01-08 13:53:27] <chimp-> im back whats the latest
[2013-01-08 13:53:37] <Cooper5> Another interesting form of dead drop comes in the from of data drops.
[2013-01-08 13:53:37] <Grazza> kk
[2013-01-08 13:54:05] <chimp-> anything interesting in that crowley book?
[2013-01-08 13:54:10] <Cooper5> Physical locations that have USB sticks embedded in hidden places that you can plug a netbook into to retrieve data from.
[2013-01-08 13:54:21] <Cooper5> There are a shit ton in NYC.
[2013-01-08 13:54:35] <Grazza> huh
[2013-01-08 13:54:37] <Grazza> what are they used for?
[2013-01-08 13:54:58] <Cooper5> Just google for USB dead drops and there should be a page with a map showing a bunch of ones people put there for fun.
[2013-01-08 13:55:09] <Grazza> o
[2013-01-08 13:55:19] <Cooper5> Ones that people know about are mostly used as a hobby. Kinda like geocaching.
[2013-01-08 13:56:06] <Grazza> that sounds really cool :)
[2013-01-08 13:56:18] <Cooper5> There are only a few even in the part of my country and they all take about three hours to drive to so I haven't bothere trying to find them
[2013-01-08 13:56:28] <Cooper5> I'm thinking of making a wireless dead drop of sorts.
[2013-01-08 13:56:33] <Cooper5> Look up the pirate box.
[2013-01-08 13:56:39] <Cooper5> Really interesting concept.
[2013-01-08 13:56:56] <Cooper5> I'm planning on building one and keeping it hidden in my backpack while I go to uni.
[2013-01-08 13:57:10] <Cooper5> People can still find it by scanning for wifi networks.

[2013-01-08 14:05:54] <Cooper5> Basically all it did was just run though the quadratic formula.
[2013-01-08 14:06:28] <crash_demons> idk who wrote DQuad btw but it is slow as heck and I made my own also.
[2013-01-08 14:06:38] <crash_demons> different method though
[2013-01-08 14:06:45] <Cooper5> DQuad?
[2013-01-08 14:07:03] <crash_demons> older calculators didn't have an inbuilt quadratic function
[2013-01-08 14:07:04] <Cooper5> How could you make a slow quadratic equation app?
[2013-01-08 14:07:16] <Cooper5> Mine was instant and was like, 10 lines of code.
[2013-01-08 14:07:35] <Grazza> ^^
[2013-01-08 14:07:43] <crash_demons> idk, but dquad() took a few questions, I had enough of that and made a different one
[2013-01-08 14:07:51] <Cooper5> And this was programmed inside the calculator, with their own little version of BASIC or whatever.
[2013-01-08 14:07:52] <crash_demons> damn fingers
[2013-01-08 14:07:54] <crash_demons> *took a few seconds
[2013-01-08 14:08:05] <Cooper5> hehe
[2013-01-08 14:08:27] <soulseekah> anyone in the onion-1 console pleaes
[2013-01-08 14:09:11] <NikTitanik> i am
[2013-01-08 14:09:16] <Cooper5> I'm in, but I'm not sure I'm getting a response.
[2013-01-08 14:09:21] <Cooper5> it is taking its time.
[2013-01-08 14:09:39] <Tech1_Phone> May just have a slow tor circut cooper.
[2013-01-08 14:09:42] <soulseekah> down for me now, trying to find the output of "primes"
[2013-01-08 14:09:53] <soulseekah> but got it from the scrollback
[2013-01-08 14:10:00] <NikTitanik> there is a doublle space between 29 and 31
[2013-01-08 14:10:13] <Cooper5> It's working.
[2013-01-08 14:10:20] <Cooper5> It is just really slow.
[2013-01-08 14:10:34] <NikTitanik> also a double space between 3257 and 3259
[2013-01-08 14:11:12] * crash_demons wonders if I should start a new Google Code project for OtpXor
[2013-01-08 14:11:20] <soulseekah> so space between 29  31 and 3257  3259 and missing primes between 71 1229
[2013-01-08 14:11:25] <crash_demons> I wonder how many you can start before they tell you to piss off
[2013-01-08 14:12:34] <Lurker69> so space between 29 31 and 3257 3259 and missing primes between 71 1229  ?   where is that in CICADix
[2013-01-08 14:13:01] <Ymgve> what do you mean missing primes between 71 1229?

[2013-01-08 14:19:04] <Ymgve> it looks like the space between 29 and 31 is on the linux on the iso too

[2013-01-08 14:19:40] <Ymgve> but the linux iso has all the primes
[2013-01-08 14:19:47] <crash_demons> lol @ echoed everything instead of generated
[2013-01-08 14:19:53] <Lurker69> i am such idiot gematria primus...    ecery rune/letter has prime number attached...
[2013-01-08 14:20:56] <chimp-> is that space significant somehow?
[2013-01-08 14:21:13] <Lurker69> cicada doesnt do many typos

[2013-01-08 14:23:04] <Tech1_Phone> Ew, yahoo?
[2013-01-08 14:23:33] <crash_demons> I was part of a community, we all knew the service sucked (the protocol was neat though)
[2013-01-08 14:24:47] <Tech1_Phone> Fair enough
[2013-01-08 14:25:21] <chimp-> its better than writing a bebo status update bot
[2013-01-08 14:25:26] <chimp-> or whatever it was called
[2013-01-08 14:25:27] <soulseekah> some trivia, the onion-1 console break off when you send it "get http" and and anything close to the first line of a real HTTP header (GET / HTTP/1.0 for example)
[2013-01-08 14:26:24] <Cooper5> haha what
[2013-01-08 14:26:25] <chimp-> hmm neat
[2013-01-08 14:26:29] <NikTitanik> get returns dont have any... interesting
[2013-01-08 14:26:36] <Cooper5> I sent "get" and it replied with "don't have any"
[2013-01-08 14:26:38] <chimp-> yeah
[2013-01-08 14:26:43] <chimp-> thats something new anyway...
[2013-01-08 14:26:50] <chimp-> but its just another in the long list of mysterious onion 1 things
[2013-01-08 14:26:52] <Ymgve> not really
[2013-01-08 14:27:02] <soulseekah> also, hi == hello
[2013-01-08 14:27:03] <Ymgve> that's how it detects you're a web browser
[2013-01-08 14:27:06] <Cooper5> "get anything" give that response
[2013-01-08 14:27:07] <crash_demons> it was a good experience for me in networking. a lot of different program design and use of structs
[2013-01-08 14:27:20] <chimp-> i mean ymgve,
[2013-01-08 14:27:25] <Cooper5> "get butts"
[2013-01-08 14:27:30] <chimp-> its another thing onion 1 does that is odd, other than just the hello hexdump
[2013-01-08 14:27:31] <Cooper5> "don't have any"
[2013-01-08 14:28:03] <soulseekah> also "get 3301" == "hi" == "hello"
[2013-01-08 14:28:05] <Tech1_Phone> Cooper, GET (or POST) is always done in caps. See if it changes
[2013-01-08 14:28:13] <soulseekah> no it's case insensitive
[2013-01-08 14:28:18] <Tech1_Phone> ah, fair enough
[2013-01-08 14:28:25] <soulseekah> and it only detects gets
[2013-01-08 14:28:29] <Cooper5> hang on.
[2013-01-08 14:28:32] <Cooper5> Gotta reconnect to it.
[2013-01-08 14:28:34] <soulseekah> "get http" triggers it off
[2013-01-08 14:28:39] <chimp-> well i have determined onion 1 has no friends anyway
[2013-01-08 14:28:42] <Tech1_Phone> hm. Fair enough
[2013-01-08 14:28:47] <Cooper5> yeah I got kicked off when I get http 'd it
[2013-01-08 14:29:19] <Cooper5> Caps doesn't change
[2013-01-08 14:29:23] <Ymgve> hm, get 1033 gives the same
[2013-01-08 14:29:31] <Cooper5> And POST does not exist as a command.
[2013-01-08 14:30:00] <chimp-> what is that hexdump get 1033 gives
[2013-01-08 14:30:05] <chimp-> the same as hello ?
[2013-01-08 14:30:19] <Ymgve> same as hello and get 3301
[2013-01-08 14:30:21] <soulseekah> yes
[2013-01-08 14:30:25] <soulseekah> and hi too
[2013-01-08 14:30:31] <Cooper5> Yep.
[2013-01-08 14:30:53] <Cooper5> What about hint?
[2013-01-08 14:31:01] <soulseekah> hint == clue
[2013-01-08 14:31:02] <Cooper5> What did people xor that one with?
[2013-01-08 14:31:02] <chimp-> same as clue
[2013-01-08 14:31:08] <soulseekah> _500.00
[2013-01-08 14:31:15] <Cooper5> Hmm
[2013-01-08 14:31:25] <Cooper5> I tried xoring those two together but didn't get anything usable.
[2013-01-08 14:31:34] <soulseekah> get 1033 == get 3301
[2013-01-08 14:31:43] <Cooper5> Nothing but garbage data.
[2013-01-08 14:31:54] <chimp-> did you xor the folly and wisdom stuff
[2013-01-08 14:32:04] <Cooper5> not yet. I'll try that right now.
[2013-01-08 14:32:22] <NikTitanik> they are the same...
[2013-01-08 14:32:47] <soulseekah> I xord folly and wisdom against each other with offset
[2013-01-08 14:32:51] <soulseekah> nothing caught my eye
[2013-01-08 14:32:59] <Cooper5> Okay.
[2013-01-08 14:33:06] <soulseekah> had it runningi nt he background, was expecting to see base64 or a ---PGP
[2013-01-08 14:33:13] <soulseekah> could have been a binary file though, so
[2013-01-08 14:33:21] <Ymgve> get help works
[2013-01-08 14:33:23] <Ymgve> but boring result
[2013-01-08 14:33:24] <soulseekah> but I couldn't afford to analyze each of the 4k offsets
[2013-01-08 14:34:27] <chimp-> same for get hint
[2013-01-08 14:34:46] <chimp-> but not get clue
[2013-01-08 14:36:35] <Ymgve> get primes
[2013-01-08 14:36:35] <Ymgve> Don't have any.
[2013-01-08 14:36:40] <Ymgve> that's a filthy lie!
[2013-01-08 14:36:41] <chimp-> thats a damn lie
[2013-01-08 14:36:42] <chimp-> lol
[2013-01-08 14:37:53] <crash_demons> in unrelated news, how do you get PuTTY to save proxy settings?
[2013-01-08 14:38:06] <crash_demons> I have to type it in. every. time.
[2013-01-08 14:38:13] <NikTitanik> you simply save the session
[2013-01-08 14:38:15] <chimp-> load save ?

[2013-01-08 14:38:29] <NikTitanik> type everything in and thr under session enter a name and click save
[2013-01-08 14:38:32] <crash_demons> that only is for Sessions
[2013-01-08 14:38:41] <NikTitanik> not really
[2013-01-08 14:38:44] <Grazza> it saves everything
[2013-01-08 14:39:03] <crash_demons> oh then it's already saved. cool.
[2013-01-08 14:39:04] <chimp-> actually ive just noticed
[2013-01-08 14:39:07] <chimp-> my proxy settings are wrong
[2013-01-08 14:39:17] <chimp-> oh wait no
[2013-01-08 14:39:20] <chimp-> hadnt loaded. dur
[2013-01-08 14:39:41] <crash_demons> the way it's organized I thought Sessions were distinct from the other settings
[2013-01-08 14:39:44] <crash_demons> the treeview is organized that way I mean
[2013-01-08 14:40:37] <Cooper5> So what's this about putty? Are you using putty to connect to the first onion?
[2013-01-08 14:40:55] <NikTitanik> we're telneting it
[2013-01-08 14:41:04] <NikTitanik> the first onion
[2013-01-08 14:41:21] <NikTitanik> and we get this console in which we can input commands
[2013-01-08 14:43:06] <chimp-> someone break out a ouija board and commune with the soul of aleistar crowley
[2013-01-08 14:43:10] <chimp-> maybe he can help us out here

[2013-01-08 19:07:05] <lulzorz> reason I'm asking instead of regging myself is because you need 5 posts to post links

[2013-01-08 19:14:36] <Ymgve> too many ascii chars in the first 16 or so bytes to be random
[2013-01-08 19:14:52] <soulseekah> like a header

[2013-01-08 19:18:45] <NikTitanik> why was the hint decoded? why wasnt it as simple as the hello message?
[2013-01-08 19:20:22] <soulseekah> the hello message also be decoded with xor 3301.iso and an offset of 3301
[2013-01-08 19:20:39] <Ymgve> of course, the same is true for any message and any small offset
[2013-01-08 19:21:14] <lulzorz> which is funny because 3301@3301 is all 0
[2013-01-08 19:21:22] <lulzorz> or maybe they meant hex 3301 offset?
[2013-01-08 19:21:33] <Ymgve> hex 3301 isn't prime
[2013-01-08 19:21:35] <Ymgve> (probably)
[2013-01-08 19:21:38] <NikTitanik> but the hello message was simple, we only needed to translate the hex to ascii, with the hint, we also needed to xor it. im telling you, there is something more with the hint to be done

[2013-01-08 19:23:23] <soulseekah> I don't think that the footers to the hexdumps are in hex
[2013-01-08 19:23:25] <soulseekah> they're decimal
[2013-01-08 19:23:34] <soulseekah> like col: 65 - is 65 decimal, 65 bytes
[2013-01-08 19:23:52] <soulseekah> so Offset: 3301 would probably be assumed to be decimal too
[2013-01-08 19:24:16] <soulseekah> Lines are also given in decimal under dumps, and match the number of lines dumped

[2013-01-08 19:38:20] <soulseekah> Atlas_, minor observasions, trivia
[2013-01-08 19:38:36] <NikTitanik> i xored the hint from _560.00 (or the other way around) at the offset of 256R and used the "file" command on the file
[2013-01-08 19:38:44] <NikTitanik> out: Dyalog APL version 213 .197
[2013-01-08 19:38:45] <Atlas_> This is so addicting, I can't stop thinking about random stuff, trying to puzzle things together that have no relation at all, lol
[2013-01-08 19:39:02] <indigo_|School> Dayalog APL a Programming Framework I think
[2013-01-08 19:39:03] <chimp-> Atlas, typing "primes" spits out a list of primes, omitting prime numberse between 71 and 1229
[2013-01-08 19:39:05] <Ymgve> probably file that gets confused
[2013-01-08 19:39:07] <soulseekah> NikTitanik, coincidence probably
[2013-01-08 19:39:12] <indigo_|School> Could be what the file was compiled with
[2013-01-08 19:39:12] <NikTitanik> yeah...
[2013-01-08 19:39:22] <soulseekah> NikTitanik, the magic number just happened to be that of APL

[2013-01-08 19:39:32] <indigo_|School> It probobly leaves a watermark
[2013-01-08 19:39:49] <indigo_|School> But maybe we could use the framwork to either reverse, or predict the process

[2013-01-08 19:41:42] <indigo_|School> Ymgve : How could the file point to a different framework? then was used?

[2013-01-08 20:03:18] <soulseekah> perhaps the runes table is there to help us build up a string that adds up to 3301 or 1033 or something like Ymgve suggested above with his yyyyyyyyyyt string

[2013-01-08 20:04:21] <Ymgve> today's brain teaser: is it possible to generate any number above two by summing primes and why/why not
[2013-01-08 20:04:42] <NikTitanik> yes
[2013-01-08 20:04:50] <soulseekah> 1+2
[2013-01-08 20:05:03] <Ymgve> 1 isn't prime!
[2013-01-08 20:05:08] <soulseekah> k
[2013-01-08 20:05:09] <Ymgve> (or so they tell me)
[2013-01-08 20:05:14] <absolutezeroff> 1 is 1
[2013-01-08 20:05:20] <absolutezeroff> it's too cool for classification
[2013-01-08 20:05:51] <artea> yes ymgve, all numbers above 2 can be factored into primes

[2013-01-08 20:07:51] <lulzorz> coincidentally, 3299+2 is an example of this
[2013-01-08 20:08:16] <Ymgve> to be specific, you can get within 3 numbers of a number by simply adding 2s
[2013-01-08 20:08:25] <Ymgve> and then you either add 2 or 3 to reach the final number
[2013-01-08 20:09:05] <chimp-> ive gone through all of the prime numbers omitted by the 'primes' command on the shell, circling whether they are reversible or palindromic primes

[2013-01-08 20:09:40] <Ymgve> at least you are doing something

[2013-01-08 20:16:18] <soulseekah> Ymgve, indeed, out of the 6 errors [ 'unrecognized command', 'SYNTAX ERROR', 'Not a typewriter', 'command or file name', 'command not found', 'not seem to exist' ] the last one is not from any known prompts
[2013-01-08 20:16:40] <Ymgve> yeah, but I was wondering about the formatting of unrecognized command
[2013-01-08 20:16:43] <Ymgve> it seems weird

[2013-01-08 20:52:32] <lulzorz> unless someone wants to go looking for runes
[2013-01-08 20:52:53] <soulseekah> find a count of runes for a phrase that equals 3301
[2013-01-08 20:53:39] <lulzorz> which is messing with the shell, which Tech1 doesn't like
[2013-01-08 20:53:40] <Tech1> here's a question, last year, did they use any clues that were outside of the game? like an image hosted on some random domain?
[2013-01-08 20:53:46] <Tech1> i know the long numerical .com
[2013-01-08 20:53:54] <lulzorz> there were posters and shit
[2013-01-08 20:54:00] <Tech1> yeah, i saw that bit
[2013-01-08 20:54:26] <lulzorz> and they did have the second chance, which had some resources on TXT records for various numerical domains
[2013-01-08 20:55:10] <soulseekah> only domain I seen so far was nowhere.com (source of twitter messages)

[2013-01-08 20:55:58] <JackHinds> why do you need a phrase that equals 3301?

[2013-01-08 21:35:18] <lulzorz> being a router is disabled by default, and so is being an exit

[2013-01-08 21:52:39] <Absence_> They let us get it; so it was as much there fault for letting us get this close to them.

[2013-01-08 21:54:29] <Absence_> Unless they owned Linode its impractical that they could remove footprints.
[2013-01-08 21:54:35] <Absence_> I can do it via Skype.
[2013-01-08 21:54:43] <Tech1> right, but do you really think they'll give that info up over the phone?
[2013-01-08 21:54:45] <soulseekah> Absence_, not really about footprints, rather about to get to know the state of ther server
[2013-01-08 21:54:49] <perplexed> if they owned linode, they'd dorp us the next hint there maybe?
[2013-01-08 21:54:54] <soulseekah> like, you know, maybe the server is free
[2013-01-08 21:55:00] <soulseekah> and not tied to any account anymore

[2013-01-08 21:55:21] <soulseekah> you don't need to lie too much, maximum is get them to switch it on
[2013-01-08 21:55:25] <Absence_> Well it depends on what we establish we are going to SE.
[2013-01-08 21:55:33] <soulseekah> if it's off, and if it's even active
[2013-01-08 21:55:41] <Tech1> we could probably determine if it's up or down.
[2013-01-08 21:55:48] <Absence_> I'm not a hell-of-a-SE but I can get the job done, considering I've done sort-of like this missions before.
[2013-01-08 21:55:54] <soulseekah> Tech1, it's probabaly simply off
[2013-01-08 21:55:57] <Tech1> yeah
[2013-01-08 21:55:58] <perplexed> the trick is not to ask for information, but rather to ask them to see if they can get the information
[2013-01-08 21:56:00] <Tech1> that's exactly what i think

[2013-01-08 21:57:03] <AlooGobi> alright, go for it.
[2013-01-08 21:57:06] =-= Cuboid3301 is now known as Cuboid|Gone_Some
[2013-01-08 21:57:07] <Absence_> We should create some type of backstory to make sure its full proof.
[2013-01-08 21:57:14] <soulseekah> it doesn't really matter, main thing is to find out the state of the server
[2013-01-08 21:57:14] <Absence_> I want to know exactly what I should be aiming for.
[2013-01-08 21:57:20] =-= Cuboid|Gone_Some is now known as Cuboid|Out
[2013-01-08 21:57:21] <perplexed> or
[2013-01-08 21:57:23] <soulseekah> is it even active as in "tied to an active account"
[2013-01-08 21:57:27] <perplexed> we could have like 5 people call right after eachother
[2013-01-08 21:57:28] <Absence_> They will give me that information without lies.
[2013-01-08 21:57:29] <soulseekah> or was the account terminated by the owner
[2013-01-08 21:57:35] <soulseekah> only 1 call
[2013-01-08 21:57:40] <AlooGobi> Hi, I have a site on your server. Can you give me information on the state of the server/
[2013-01-08 21:57:41] <perplexed> company freaking out
[2013-01-08 21:57:51] <soulseekah> AlooGobi, probably something like that
[2013-01-08 21:57:52] <perplexed> yeah keep it simple
[2013-01-08 21:57:57] <Absence_> If I say I have a site on there server they'll ask for my account name.
[2013-01-08 21:58:01] <Absence_> They check the accounts.
[2013-01-08 21:58:05] <soulseekah> Absence_, tell them you're at the airport
[2013-01-08 21:58:08] <soulseekah> no internet access
[2013-01-08 21:58:11] <soulseekah> clients called - site is down
[2013-01-08 21:58:19] <AlooGobi> Can you look up the state of an Ip for me?
[2013-01-08 21:58:21] <Absence_> They'll still need my account name.
[2013-01-08 21:58:26] <soulseekah> can you check if all is ok with the server
[2013-01-08 21:58:32] <soulseekah> and switch it on if it's shutdown
[2013-01-08 21:58:41] <soulseekah> you don't remember it
[2013-01-08 21:58:43] <Absence_> Do we have the actual IP or what?
[2013-01-08 21:58:52] <AlooGobi> You can pressure them into something. They'll be worried through their broken english if anything
[2013-01-08 21:58:53] <soulseekah> hostname or IP
[2013-01-08 21:58:56] <soulseekah> probably hostname
[2013-01-08 21:58:59] <soulseekah> anyone been with linode?
[2013-01-08 21:59:03] <soulseekah> or is with linode
[2013-01-08 21:59:04] <Tech1> yeah, i have been soul
[2013-01-08 21:59:13] <AlooGobi> great ^
[2013-01-08 21:59:16] <soulseekah> Tech1, called them any time?
[2013-01-08 21:59:17] <Tech1> 1 sec, trying to see what i can dig up
[2013-01-08 21:59:21] <Tech1> nah, never.
[2013-01-08 21:59:23] <soulseekah> like what do they ask for?
[2013-01-08 21:59:27] <soulseekah> maybe last transaction iD
[2013-01-08 21:59:31] <Cosmo_> This is a bad idea
[2013-01-08 21:59:31] <soulseekah> or something ese
[2013-01-08 21:59:33] <absolutezeroff> wait have we done anything in the last hour or so beyond what wiki says
[2013-01-08 21:59:37] <Tech1> no absolutezeroff
[2013-01-08 21:59:39] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, nothing to lose really
[2013-01-08 21:59:55] <soulseekah> absolutezeroff, exactly, no progress for quite a while
[2013-01-08 22:00:02] <soulseekah> so returning to crazy ideas
[2013-01-08 22:00:05] <Absence_> And at this point, we need to know if we're at a dead on the onion or not.
[2013-01-08 22:00:07] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, why not?
[2013-01-08 22:00:27] <Tech1> well, my old linode login is dead, so much for showing the dash
[2013-01-08 22:00:32] <Absence_> Okay, if they ask what I have tied to the server what do I say?
[2013-01-08 22:00:43] <soulseekah> what have you tied?
[2013-01-08 22:00:44] <AlooGobi> This is really out of the games boundries. But they have us running around the world for QR codes. So maybe not..
[2013-01-08 22:00:44] <Cosmo_> IT's just not a good idea, that's what I think.
[2013-01-08 22:00:54] <Tech1> an API for a web app
[2013-01-08 22:00:56] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, worst thing - we get nothing.
[2013-01-08 22:01:12] <Cosmo_> No, worst thing, the game ends.
[2013-01-08 22:01:24] <soulseekah> you think they messed up yesterday?
[2013-01-08 22:01:33] <soulseekah> by leaking the hostname
[2013-01-08 22:01:48] |<-- Cuboid|Out has left freenode (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[2013-01-08 22:01:50] <AlooGobi> You have a point. but if they covered their bases with this webhost. They probably have it locked down as wlel
[2013-01-08 22:01:53] <Tech1> TBH soulseekah, i think it may have been a mistake.  but they didn't loose any ground over it. not as far as i can tell at least
[2013-01-08 22:02:06] <Absence_> Okay. I'll say "One of my clients have called me and told me they recieve an error saying 'API can not be resolved on <hostname>. Contact the webmaster for more information.' Could you give me the current state of this hostname?"
[2013-01-08 22:02:15] <Tech1> ohno! we know the name of the $15/month VPS you rented!
[2013-01-08 22:02:26] <soulseekah> so we find out - if account is terminated - supports says: "this hostname is currently inactive" then it was a mistake
[2013-01-08 22:02:34] <soulseekah> and they clearly shut things down after the hostname leaked
[2013-01-08 22:02:46] <soulseekah> if it's still active, then it may not have been a mistake
[2013-01-08 22:02:48] <Tech1> i'm not sold this will work.
[2013-01-08 22:02:57] <Absence_> What do we lose if it won't work?
[2013-01-08 22:03:01] <Tech1> you have to realize this is a tech company that's been around
[2013-01-08 22:03:08] <Tech1> don't you think they have some sort of anti-se training?
[2013-01-08 22:03:30] <soulseekah> Tech1, stuff happens
[2013-01-08 22:03:45] <soulseekah> depends on who's on the other end
[2013-01-08 22:03:48] <Tech1> they are pretty much _the_ goto for vps, espicially devving something like a saas
[2013-01-08 22:03:58] <AlooGobi> These guys aren't a mushroom company, are they?
[2013-01-08 22:04:02] <soulseekah> well no harm in finding out how "Flexible" they are
[2013-01-08 22:04:05] <soulseekah> tell them ou
[2013-01-08 22:04:08] <Tech1> touche
[2013-01-08 22:04:22] <AlooGobi> Go for it Absence, you'll do great !
[2013-01-08 22:04:24] <soulseekah> you're not at the computer etc. no interent at the moment, just need to find out what the matter is
[2013-01-08 22:04:38] <Absence_> I want to see if they have a livechat. I sound more convincing behind text.
[2013-01-08 22:04:42] <Tech1> i think that's a bit more logical
[2013-01-08 22:04:46] <Tech1> dn't think they do Absence_
[2013-01-08 22:04:49] <soulseekah> Absence_, I looked for live chat yesteday myself
[2013-01-08 22:04:57] <soulseekah> it's behind closed doors (login form)

[2013-01-08 22:06:13] <Tech1> http://li528-4.members.linode.com/ confirm with soulseekah
[2013-01-08 22:06:14] <soulseekah> although on the other hand, how would you know those host names
[2013-01-08 22:06:21] <soulseekah> and not know your login/email
[2013-01-08 22:06:42] <AlooGobi> read it out slowly, as if your clients texted it to you.
[2013-01-08 22:06:44] <soulseekah> probably best to give the IP
[2013-01-08 22:06:50] <soulseekah> instead of the hostname
[2013-01-08 22:06:56] <AlooGobi> ^

[2013-01-08 22:07:13] <soulseekah> they might ask for the name
[2013-01-08 22:07:26] <soulseekah> Tech1, interesting piece of info
[2013-01-08 22:07:28] <NikTitanik> btw, when the site was online, it was only accesible throught the port 81
[2013-01-08 22:07:46] <Lurker69> Offset: 0, Skip: 0, Col: 65, Line: 988    that last line....

[2013-01-08 22:08:03] <Absence_> I'll say "The webmaster is currently out of town somewhere and I do not have his personal contact number. I'd like to know if l-i-5-2-8-dash-4-dot-members-dot-linode-dot-com is up? I think its the server the api runs on."
[2013-01-08 22:08:16] <soulseekah> Lurker69, all of the footers to hexdumps have so far been like that
[2013-01-08 22:08:26] <soulseekah> Absence_, not exactly though
[2013-01-08 22:08:47] <rr645> You could make it more panicky--the webmaster won't answer his phone/no one knows where he is--to try to provoke a sense of urgency and of sympathy
[2013-01-08 22:08:49] <soulseekah> ask whether you can get the state of the server perhaps
[2013-01-08 22:08:51] <Absence_> "the coder that works for this project is on vacation and didnt give me his contact."
[2013-01-08 22:08:56] <soulseekah> beat around the bush a bit?
[2013-01-08 22:09:02] <AlooGobi> Refer to the IP first, if they don't comply, go for the wbhost
[2013-01-08 22:09:05] <soulseekah> Absence_, good story
[2013-01-08 22:09:12] <soulseekah> vanished freelancer - hell of a headache
[2013-01-08 22:09:23] <soulseekah> no contact info, make up a name
[2013-01-08 22:09:28] <soulseekah> say he registered the VPS
[2013-01-08 22:09:35] <soulseekah> so you have no info at all really
[2013-01-08 22:09:36] <AlooGobi> lurker69: what set of numbers is that tweet referring to?
[2013-01-08 22:09:40] <soulseekah> something like that
[2013-01-08 22:09:44] <soulseekah> who knows, more ideas?
[2013-01-08 22:10:01] <AlooGobi> Tech1 : have you ever had to deal with customer support?
[2013-01-08 22:10:12] <Tech1> no, thankfully i didn't
[2013-01-08 22:10:17] <soulseekah> I have. countless times, over live chat though
[2013-01-08 22:10:25] <soulseekah> and I always had the client info (transaction numbers, logins)
[2013-01-08 22:10:27] <Tech1> techsupport for my dedi server is awesome! but...that's not through linode. haha
[2013-01-08 22:10:35] <AlooGobi> So I imagine it's built with sticks and bubblegum?
[2013-01-08 22:10:54] <Absence_> Remember guys, a fifteen year old social engineer got into the whole GoDaddy WHCMS panel by SEing call support.
[2013-01-08 22:10:55] <soulseekah> so Absence_, final thoughts?
[2013-01-08 22:11:09] <AlooGobi> Do you think they over-the-phone support will be workable?
[2013-01-08 22:11:24] <soulseekah> Only try and see, get a feel for it
[2013-01-08 22:11:32] <soulseekah> we can try 2-3 other times later
[2013-01-08 22:11:39] <soulseekah> say call accounting instead
[2013-01-08 22:11:45] <AlooGobi> Godaddy has an english work force, I doubt these guys will.
[2013-01-08 22:11:48] <soulseekah> ask for blocked charges
[2013-01-08 22:12:01] <soulseekah> I say just do it
[2013-01-08 22:12:02] <AlooGobi> Yea, Lets do this. No point in speculation.
[2013-01-08 22:12:07] <Tech1> Absence_: yes, but you're not cosmo

[2013-01-08 22:12:32] <Ymgve> this just sounds like a really really bad idea
[2013-01-08 22:12:55] <Cosmo_> ^Yep
[2013-01-08 22:12:58] <daemos> what is?
[2013-01-08 22:13:04] <Tech1> i'm with Ymgve
[2013-01-08 22:13:15] <soulseekah> Just pry a bit, see if it's even active, it's probably deactivated and account has been terminated

[2013-01-08 22:13:48] <AlooGobi> soul, lets think of think of the possible consequences. just for a second.
[2013-01-08 22:13:59] <soulseekah> worst thing - game ends for too much sniffing around
[2013-01-08 22:14:00] <Cosmo_> They just don't seem like the sort of people that will appreciate this.
[2013-01-08 22:14:05] <daemos> what is he going to do?
[2013-01-08 22:14:06] <soulseekah> meaning host was leaked by mistake
[2013-01-08 22:14:09] <AlooGobi> What do cosmo and ymgve think will happen if it doesnt work?
[2013-01-08 22:14:29] <rr645> I have to go for a little while--if you do make the call, good luck!
[2013-01-08 22:14:34] =-= rr645 is now known as rr645-away
[2013-01-08 22:14:47] <Ymgve> the cicada people will decide you're breaking the rules of the game and stop it
[2013-01-08 22:14:54] <soulseekah> what are the rules?
[2013-01-08 22:15:00] <Cosmo_> They don't want people to know ANYTHING about them, too much knowledge made them call it off last year. I just think...These are the kind of people that want you playing by the rules
[2013-01-08 22:15:01] <Tech1> i'm sure cicada are seeing this as we type it.
[2013-01-08 22:15:04] <Cosmo_> or not at all
[2013-01-08 22:15:14] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, so the hostname leak was a fail
[2013-01-08 22:15:35] <soulseekah> and can actually be traced (with the right amount of resources) back to whoever paid for the VPS
[2013-01-08 22:15:54] <AlooGobi> Nothing is true... Everything is permitted
[2013-01-08 22:15:55] <daemos> and find cicada?
[2013-01-08 22:16:22] <soulseekah> probably not, but someone who paid for the VPS
[2013-01-08 22:16:29] <Tech1> in theory daemos, who ever paid for the vps
[2013-01-08 22:16:32] <Tech1> but
[2013-01-08 22:16:39] <Tech1> i'm sure that's way out of bounds.
[2013-01-08 22:16:41] <Cosmo_> I was only saying what I think, if you want to make the call, do it
[2013-01-08 22:16:48] <AlooGobi> mfw its all a bunch of alien bugs
[2013-01-08 22:16:53] <soulseekah> OK, let's wait another 24 hours
[2013-01-08 22:17:07] <soulseekah> if nothing turns up we bring the topic of se linode up again
[2013-01-08 22:17:09] <perplexed> that's hypocritical though. if they're all about opening up all knowledge, they should be happy if people start chasing them down and breaking the rules
[2013-01-08 22:17:13] <AlooGobi> ^
[2013-01-08 22:17:17] <soulseekah> and see how we feel about it tomorrow
[2013-01-08 22:17:28] <Cosmo_> But that's the point i was making
[2013-01-08 22:17:35] <Tech1> didn' the creepypasta from last year say something about info being free? ...but i also remember that there was something about rules.
[2013-01-08 22:17:37] <Cosmo_> if they want the knowledge shared, why did the dtop it last year?
[2013-01-08 22:17:40] <Tech1> who has the last leaked email?
[2013-01-08 22:17:42] <lulzorz> this is not out of bounds
[2013-01-08 22:17:43] <lulzorz> this is an alternate reality game
[2013-01-08 22:17:47] <lulzorz> that means we use reality, everything we have
[2013-01-08 22:18:02] <lulzorz> fuzzing the console is WAY worse than SEing a host
[2013-01-08 22:18:09] <soulseekah> :D
[2013-01-08 22:18:10] <perplexed> and you can either crack the code and open the safe, or smash it with a hammer

[2013-01-08 22:19:20] <Tech1> i think it's out of bounds, but it's not me calling.
[2013-01-08 22:19:28] <Tech1> mark me in neutral
[2013-01-08 22:19:32] <lulzorz> and as I keep saying, 3301 has done these servers perfectly many times
[2013-01-08 22:19:35] <zebra> I haven't said anything so far, but it does sound like a bad idea...
[2013-01-08 22:19:36] <lulzorz> there's no reason for them to fuck it up on several counts this time
[2013-01-08 22:19:53] <Tech1> and this is my first ARG, i don't know how these things go
[2013-01-08 22:19:54] <Absence_> They're looking for highly intelligent indiviuals. They're looking for people that would do this.
[2013-01-08 22:20:02] <Tech1> has anyone, in any past ARG, SE-ed a hosting company?
[2013-01-08 22:20:21] <soulseekah> otp SE'd a librarian into getting a CD
[2013-01-08 22:20:25] <soulseekah> from a booth that was crashed into
[2013-01-08 22:20:59] <Absence_> Would anyone like to join me in this skype call. 1 person at most; someone whom has contributed
[2013-01-08 22:21:05] <primius> Tech1: on OTP we had multiple people who worked for the phone company pulling records for us from the LEO access system

[2013-01-08 22:21:57] <Tech1> well protected i'd assume.

[2013-01-08 22:22:46] <ArtemisX> hey guys any updates since last night?
[2013-01-08 22:22:46] <Tech1> touche
[2013-01-08 22:22:49] <soulseekah> Absence_, don't worry about streamin or even recoding
[2013-01-08 22:22:50] <AlooGobi> Ah, alright. Thats okay.
[2013-01-08 22:22:54] <soulseekah> it's just support
[2013-01-08 22:22:55] <Tech1> stand by to stand by ArtemisX
[2013-01-08 22:22:59] <Absence_> I have a mp3 skype recorder.
[2013-01-08 22:23:02] <alexanderthegrey> i think these people are good enough that if there was a hole in their servers there is probably a purpose
[2013-01-08 22:23:04] <soulseekah> it's not important
[2013-01-08 22:23:05] <lulzorz> it would be cool to have a recording
[2013-01-08 22:23:10] <ArtemisX> Tech1: wa? e_E
[2013-01-08 22:23:13] <lulzorz> but mask your voice or something
[2013-01-08 22:23:21] <Cooper5> If two computers on a home network are connected to TOR, would the second one have trouble fethcing .onions?
[2013-01-08 22:23:23] <Absence_> How?
[2013-01-08 22:23:24] <soulseekah> exactly ^
[2013-01-08 22:23:24] <Tech1> ArtemisX: watch chat
[2013-01-08 22:23:25] <Absence_> Clownfish?
[2013-01-08 22:23:25] <soulseekah> I wouldn't
[2013-01-08 22:23:29] <soulseekah> even bother recording
[2013-01-08 22:23:33] <ArtemisX> kk tech
[2013-01-08 22:23:40] <lulzorz> Cooper5: wouldn't
[2013-01-08 22:23:42] <AlooGobi> Artemis, what we're doing is trying to call the server that the site is hosted on. We found it through a "whois" search
[2013-01-08 22:23:43] <soulseekah> too much trouble, just prepare
[2013-01-08 22:23:51] <Absence_> Alright
[2013-01-08 22:24:01] <Absence_> Lets being by establishing my opening line.
[2013-01-08 22:24:04] <soulseekah> and then tell us the relevant bit of info we're seeking
[2013-01-08 22:24:06] <Cooper5> For some reason, I can't get my laptop to fetch the first onion.
[2013-01-08 22:24:08] <lulzorz> Absence_: would you like a quick brief on linode?
[2013-01-08 22:24:14] <Absence_> Yes.
[2013-01-08 22:24:16] <soulseekah> - is the server up? active? or terminated?
[2013-01-08 22:24:19] <AlooGobi> are you starting now absence?
[2013-01-08 22:24:20] <soulseekah> - can it be switched on?
[2013-01-08 22:24:26] <zebra> I couldnt get on the onion earlier also
[2013-01-08 22:24:30] <Absence_> No, not until I'm full proof.
[2013-01-08 22:24:44] <ArtemisX> Tech what am i waiting for?
[2013-01-08 22:24:44] <lulzorz> they provide KVM access with a control panel that can select alternative boot mediums for the purposes of recovery

[2013-01-08 22:24:50] <soulseekah> also one thing that may be useful
[2013-01-08 22:24:58] <soulseekah> is to scan the subnet
[2013-01-08 22:25:01] <lulzorz> lots of linux users have VPSes for personal use there
[2013-01-08 22:25:02] <soulseekah> for the 1-st onion
[2013-01-08 22:25:06] <soulseekah> it's bound to be close by
[2013-01-08 22:25:12] <Tech1> soulseekah: i like your thinking
[2013-01-08 22:25:15] <Cooper5> I am connected on my first machine and the onion is responding to commands, but I can't even establish a connection on the second machine.
[2013-01-08 22:25:16] <soulseekah> I scanned around a dozen on port 80 though
[2013-01-08 22:25:19] <Tech1> IE: they bought a VPS with 4 IPs
[2013-01-08 22:25:20] <soulseekah> like .5 is a chinese site
[2013-01-08 22:25:24] <lulzorz> american company, IIRC, so you'd better get cracking before the end of business day
[2013-01-08 22:25:25] <soulseekah> .6 is something else
[2013-01-08 22:25:26] <Tech1> DUDE
[2013-01-08 22:25:33] <Tech1> that would explain why this site was hosted on :81
[2013-01-08 22:25:36] <soulseekah> etc. something close may be the first onion
[2013-01-08 22:25:39] <Tech1> wait
[2013-01-08 22:25:40] <Tech1> no
[2013-01-08 22:25:41] <Tech1> nevermind
[2013-01-08 22:25:43] <Tech1> fuck i'm stupid
[2013-01-08 22:25:48] <soulseekah> remember the 1st onion is still up
[2013-01-08 22:25:54] <soulseekah> and chances are it's hosted on linode too
[2013-01-08 22:25:56] <Tech1> yeah
[2013-01-08 22:25:58] <Ymgve> can't you use vhosts with onion addresses
[2013-01-08 22:26:04] <soulseekah> and registreed nearby, probably same subnet
[2013-01-08 22:26:11] <Tech1> purchased around the same time, presumably
[2013-01-08 22:26:16] <lulzorz> everything else I think you can find on the company website
[2013-01-08 22:26:17] <lulzorz> but it would be good to figure out if this IP is shared or not
[2013-01-08 22:26:17] <lulzorz> anyone got info on that?
[2013-01-08 22:26:29] <Tech1> soulseekah, i'm on it
[2013-01-08 22:26:33] <lulzorz> Ymgve: of course
[2013-01-08 22:26:37] <Cosmo_> Is it bad that I don't think they're japanese because of the cicada sound in the mp3?
[2013-01-08 22:26:37] <soulseekah> lulzorz, it's a VPS
[2013-01-08 22:26:40] <ArtemisX> Tech1 What Am I Waiting for?
[2013-01-08 22:26:44] <Cosmo_> I think I'm losing my mind.
[2013-01-08 22:26:45] <lulzorz> Ymgve: but they just up and bound to 0.0.0.0, lulz
[2013-01-08 22:26:49] <Absence_> Okay.
[2013-01-08 22:26:51] <Tech1> ArtemisX: the SE.
[2013-01-08 22:26:55] <Absence_> Opening line.
[2013-01-08 22:27:00] <ArtemisX> The SE?
[2013-01-08 22:27:05] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, they're not Japanese, linode's server is in Japan though
[2013-01-08 22:27:08] <soulseekah> that particular one
[2013-01-08 22:27:15] <soulseekah> it's probably of no relevance
[2013-01-08 22:27:18] <ArtemisX> Tech1 Whats An SE?
[2013-01-08 22:27:22] <Ymgve> of course, onion1 can't be vhosted because it doesn't support http
[2013-01-08 22:27:25] <AlooGobi> Social engineering
[2013-01-08 22:27:42] <Cosmo_> Oh ok, well I've been trying to work out WHERE they are. 3 of us have
[2013-01-08 22:27:48] <Absence_> the guy running our project is currently out of town somewhere and I do not have his personal contact number. I'd like to know if l-i-5-2-8-dash-4-dot-members-dot-linode-dot-com is up? I think its the server the api runs on.
[2013-01-08 22:27:56] <soulseekah> and onion1 can't be portscanned either
[2013-01-08 22:28:08] <soulseekah> Absence_, name the IP not the host
[2013-01-08 22:28:09] <ArtemisX> ah...
[2013-01-08 22:28:15] <soulseekah> Absence_, faster and less room for mistake
[2013-01-08 22:28:25] <soulseekah> and beat around the bush a bit
[2013-01-08 22:28:29] <soulseekah> as if you don't really know what you're doing
[2013-01-08 22:28:39] <AlooGobi> Keep confident, no need for rush
[2013-01-08 22:29:02] <Absence_> Should I say everytime we open our mobile app we keep getting an error "api can not resolve to 106.186.17.4"

[2013-01-08 22:29:49] <soulseekah> Absence_, you have a problem - your server is simply not working
[2013-01-08 22:29:53] <soulseekah> and you're not at your workstation
[2013-01-08 22:30:01] <soulseekah> and your coder (who registered the VPS) is out of town

[2013-01-08 22:30:12] <lulzorz> soulseekah: it could be on the same one, but I think it's not likely considering the craziness with that host...onion1 is way to stable
[2013-01-08 22:30:15] <lulzorz> soulseekah: but you can certainly drop everything incoming and still host a hidden service
[2013-01-08 22:30:15] <soulseekah> and depend on the kindness of support to give you the little info yo useek
[2013-01-08 22:30:37] <lulzorz> yeah, just ask them to reset the server
[2013-01-08 22:30:41] <lulzorz> don't give a name for the freelancer
[2013-01-08 22:30:53] <lulzorz> since they'll be able to tell it's fake
[2013-01-08 22:31:04] <soulseekah> don't prepare word for word, because it will NOT go as planned
[2013-01-08 22:31:13] <soulseekah> be prepared to stick to your story and beg for help
[2013-01-08 22:31:15] <Absence_> yes but i need an idea of what to say
[2013-01-08 22:31:16] <soulseekah> that's it
[2013-01-08 22:31:23] <soulseekah> Absence_, that you're website is down

[2013-01-08 22:33:43] <soulseekah> no it will go wrong
[2013-01-08 22:33:47] <Absence_> read it and fool/full-proof it
[2013-01-08 22:33:48] <AlooGobi> you can always ask them to hold as well ;)
[2013-01-08 22:33:48] <soulseekah> it has to be natural

[2013-01-08 22:33:55] <Absence_> it will be, ive done this before
[2013-01-08 22:33:57] <Absence_> i promise.
[2013-01-08 22:33:59] <soulseekah> you have an outline
[2013-01-08 22:34:00] <soulseekah> and that's all
[2013-01-08 22:34:11] <soulseekah> making it more difficult/epic that it really has to be
[2013-01-08 22:34:17] <AlooGobi> Yea, absence, if you need help, ask them to hold, then ask us
[2013-01-08 22:34:20] <NikTitanik> well, guys. you keep arguing who is going to call, im going to sleep
[2013-01-08 22:34:20] <soulseekah> for all we know they won't even pick up

[2013-01-08 22:35:39] <Absence_> I'm going to say I run public relations for a small freelancing group. One of our client's webservers went out and I have no idea what to do. Every time they connect to the website there is an error "API can not be resolved on <IP>". I know our coder registered to you and I'd like to see if you can help.
[2013-01-08 22:35:40] <soulseekah> that's all, then see what happens, beg for some help and support will guide you
[2013-01-08 22:35:58] <soulseekah> Absence_, too overthought and direct
[2013-01-08 22:36:07] <Absence_> its the outline, I wont say that exactly

[2013-01-08 22:36:27] <Cosmo_> Just ring them and wing it
[2013-01-08 22:36:36] <soulseekah> then see what he requires and turn down every request by finding good excuses
[2013-01-08 22:36:43] <soulseekah> "Give me your ID please"
[2013-01-08 22:36:52] <Absence_> "I didn't register it."

[2013-01-08 22:37:14] <soulseekah> pry bit by bit and see how far you can get
[2013-01-08 22:37:28] <Absence_> I'm in the airport bathroom wanking off and got a text.
[2013-01-08 22:37:29] <Absence_> good?
[2013-01-08 22:37:32] <soulseekah> it's not a matter of life and death or antyhing, so

[2013-01-08 22:37:45] <Cosmo_> pretend to be the person that always gets you to fix their computer
[2013-01-08 22:37:48] <soulseekah> thank them, and that's all
[2013-01-08 22:37:50] <soulseekah> yep

[2013-01-08 22:38:51] <soulseekah> because you don't know
[2013-01-08 22:38:54] <soulseekah> what they want
[2013-01-08 22:39:02] <soulseekah> you just know what you want - the site to be up

[2013-01-08 22:40:09] <soulseekah> if that info is attainable, - try to get them to turn it on

[2013-01-08 22:42:01] <soulseekah> another thought - the server may have 2 IPs, and they just down the interface for onion2
[2013-01-08 22:42:20] <soulseekah> although it'd still be active in some way
[2013-01-08 22:42:28] <Absence_> waiting for representative

[2013-01-08 22:44:49] <soulseekah> but ok, I'll see if I can register a VPS at linode
[2013-01-08 22:44:58] <Tech1> i'm getting tons of results

[2013-01-08 22:50:35] <soulseekah> see how Apache discloses the hostname?

[2013-01-08 22:52:52] <Cosmo_> ymgve, in that palindromic page, the word 'cicadas' is in there....
[2013-01-08 22:53:11] <Ymgve> Cosmo_: well I can guarantee you that is a coincidence
[2013-01-08 22:53:23] <soulseekah> the 151 is running nginx though
[2013-01-08 22:53:28] <Cosmo_> Well it's not a palindrome :P
[2013-01-08 22:53:57] <soulseekah> Absense_ is absent still

[2013-01-08 22:54:06] <Tech1> the full list
[2013-01-08 22:54:38] <Tech1> just got to 210
[2013-01-08 22:54:47] <soulseekah> see how li528-255.members.linode.com is not resolvable
[2013-01-08 22:54:56] <soulseekah> does it mean that 255 is inactive?
[2013-01-08 22:55:10] <soulseekah> becaue our 4 (onion2) is resolvable
[2013-01-08 22:55:17] <soulseekah> which may mean it's simply switched off
[2013-01-08 22:55:20] <soulseekah> not terminated
[2013-01-08 22:55:34] <Tech1> mmm

[2013-01-08 22:55:44] <Tech1> let me see how my old linode is
[2013-01-08 22:55:48] <Tech1> if i still have the address
[2013-01-08 22:55:52] <Tech1> becuase it's terminated
[2013-01-08 22:56:13] <Ymgve> Cosmo_: the whole thing is a palindrome
[2013-01-08 22:56:24] <Cosmo_> Sweet jesus
[2013-01-08 22:56:27] <soulseekah> that would be interesting, if they remove their A records with termination after unassigning an IP - then yes
[2013-01-08 22:56:28] <Ymgve> like amanaplanacanalpanama
[2013-01-08 22:57:00] <soulseekah> then onion2 is simply switched off, on standby
[2013-01-08 22:57:23] <AlooGobi> So is onion 2 our only door to move forward?

[2013-01-08 23:00:36] <Absence_> "I can't do anything without the name to verify its with that. And then I'd need the last 6 digits of the card number"

[2013-01-08 23:00:40] <Absence_> BUT

[2013-01-08 23:03:09] <soulseekah> Tech1, editor
[2013-01-08 23:03:19] <soulseekah> use your hex editor
[2013-01-08 23:03:43] <Absence_> so they dont use the name Cicada or 3301
[2013-01-08 23:03:49] <Absence_> which means
[2013-01-08 23:03:53] <Absence_> if we actually had that info
[2013-01-08 23:03:56] <Absence_> they would give us

[2013-01-08 23:04:14] <Tech1> haha

[2013-01-08 23:04:41] <Absence_> Unless we're all looking to join there society.
[2013-01-08 23:04:42] <AlooGobi> Do we really want to? So what, we find the name and knock on his door

[2013-01-08 23:05:11] <AlooGobi> or we play nicky nine door

[2013-01-08 23:05:26] <Absence_> ACCOUNT EXISTS
[2013-01-08 23:05:33] <soulseekah> did you name your IP?
[2013-01-08 23:05:42] <Tech1> do you guys REALLY want to dox who ever is 3301?
[2013-01-08 23:05:46] <AlooGobi> well.. yea,
[2013-01-08 23:05:46] <Tech1> badidea.jpg
[2013-01-08 23:05:52] <Absence_> i did the 106.186.17.4
[2013-01-08 23:05:52] <soulseekah> no, Tech1
[2013-01-08 23:06:03] <rr645> Probably a bad idea. I rather suspect they'd kill the game in self defense
[2013-01-08 23:06:04] <soulseekah> Absence_, and he typed it in and brought up the profile associated?
[2013-01-08 23:06:05] <Tech1> i think Absence_ has a point
[2013-01-08 23:06:13] <Absence_> yeah but wanted me to verify
[2013-01-08 23:06:18] <soulseekah> Absence_, good
[2013-01-08 23:06:19] <Tech1> yeah
[2013-01-08 23:06:21] <Absence_> wouldnt let me do shit
[2013-01-08 23:06:24] <Tech1> my old info from linode is gone.
[2013-01-08 23:06:25] <soulseekah> so yes, we can assume it's on standby
[2013-01-08 23:06:26] <Absence_> "like i said"
[2013-01-08 23:06:30] <Absence_> everytime he said
[2013-01-08 23:06:32] <Absence_> "like i said"
[2013-01-08 23:06:40] <soulseekah> so onion2 hasn't been terminated yet
[2013-01-08 23:06:43] <Tech1> i can't reset my password for the account even, and the account is terminated
[2013-01-08 23:06:51] <Absence_> i said but i don't know what to do. the guy is gone and the client has less info then me.
[2013-01-08 23:06:52] <soulseekah> it's just shutdown for now
[2013-01-08 23:06:53] <Tech1> so, we can reliably assume the server is just powered off
[2013-01-08 23:07:13] <AlooGobi> Support gave no sympathy?
[2013-01-08 23:07:17] <soulseekah> probably, I think support would have said "this IP is terminaed"
[2013-01-08 23:07:22] <Absence_> nope
[2013-01-08 23:07:23] <soulseekah> "I have no related account"
[2013-01-08 23:07:24] <Absence_> none
[2013-01-08 23:07:48] <AlooGobi> Its their job. We don't want the guy to loose his job over this either
[2013-01-08 23:07:59] <soulseekah> so we got our info still, the info Absence_ called for i nthe first place
[2013-01-08 23:08:05] <soulseekah> to find out whether it was terminated
[2013-01-08 23:08:11] <Absence_> he already gave us more info then we neede.
[2013-01-08 23:08:13] <AlooGobi> which is?
[2013-01-08 23:08:24] <AlooGobi> which.. it isn't?
[2013-01-08 23:08:33] <soulseekah> and it's not, the IP is still associated with the acount and is simply shutdown for now
[2013-01-08 23:08:37] <Absence_> The account exists which mean the server is available.
[2013-01-08 23:08:42] <Tech1> correct
[2013-01-08 23:08:49] <Absence_> He also signs up using legitimate information and a different company name.
[2013-01-08 23:08:55] <Absence_> I told him a keyword would be Cicada or 3301
[2013-01-08 23:08:59] <Absence_> neither of those were there
[2013-01-08 23:09:00] <soulseekah> no that's tnot true
[2013-01-08 23:09:01] <AlooGobi> Anonymous Inc.
[2013-01-08 23:09:05] <Absence_> None-what-so-ever existed.
[2013-01-08 23:09:07] <soulseekah> he probably used false credentials
[2013-01-08 23:09:11] <soulseekah> and it wans't even him
[2013-01-08 23:09:27] <Tech1> i'm back to the subnet
[2013-01-08 23:09:30] <Absence_> Still a lead.
[2013-01-08 23:09:40] <Absence_> What would he name his company?
[2013-01-08 23:09:49] <soulseekah> don't even try to guess
[2013-01-08 23:09:54] <AlooGobi> I don't think that's to worry about
[2013-01-08 23:09:55] <soulseekah> we're probably never meant to find out
[2013-01-08 23:09:57] <soulseekah> and won't
[2013-01-08 23:09:57] <Absence_> right. haha.
[2013-01-08 23:10:09] <AlooGobi> Really though. Good job
[2013-01-08 23:10:13] <Absence_> So, we got all the information we need + possibly a little more.
[2013-01-08 23:10:21] <soulseekah> for example, we found that that 3301 on linode is a free username
[2013-01-08 23:10:39] <AlooGobi> Have you guys talked about the forest riddle?
[2013-01-08 23:10:40] <Absence_> He likely prepared for this kind of outcome.
[2013-01-08 23:10:40] <soulseekah> so is cicada, so no bothering about trying to guess
[2013-01-08 23:10:54] <Absence_> So we do know he'll cover his tracks.
[2013-01-08 23:10:56] <soulseekah> we weren't meant to go to linode
[2013-01-08 23:11:00] <Absence_> He uses credit-cards as well.
[2013-01-08 23:11:14] <soulseekah> it's not him
[2013-01-08 23:11:24] <Absence_> His assiociates.
[2013-01-08 23:11:26] <primius> remember last year when we figured out 8.com was registered with a volvo email?
[2013-01-08 23:11:39] <AlooGobi> Lets go find something to solve with the gematria prime list
[2013-01-08 23:11:41] <Absence_> oh man
[2013-01-08 23:11:42] <primius> it was some crazy hack with the web host, I forget how it worked
[2013-01-08 23:11:44] <Absence_> if i knew that meail
[2013-01-08 23:11:47] <primius> something to do with a password reset
[2013-01-08 23:11:49] <soulseekah> primius, wow
[2013-01-08 23:11:54] <Absence_> i could of attempted it
[2013-01-08 23:11:55] <primius> they only gave the domain, not the whole mail
[2013-01-08 23:12:01] <soulseekah> it was part of the assignment?
[2013-01-08 23:12:08] <soulseekah> i.e. you had to actually go there?
[2013-01-08 23:12:22] <Tech1> http://li528-240.members.linode.com/
[2013-01-08 23:12:24] <primius> no, it never lead to anything
[2013-01-08 23:12:36] <Tech1> interesting, considering i have no idea what 'winterfall studio' is
[2013-01-08 23:12:40] <soulseekah> AlooGobi, find a phrase 10-15 words which amounts to 3301
[2013-01-08 23:12:53] <soulseekah> AlooGobi, you can use the rune table or the count in console
[2013-01-08 23:13:13] <soulseekah> Tech1, probably a design studio

[2013-01-08 23:14:57] <Tech1> well, there goes that subnet
[2013-01-08 23:15:06] <Tech1> Absence_: ?
[2013-01-08 23:15:12] <Absence_> why didnt he use a bitcoin host or something
[2013-01-08 23:15:18] <Absence_> why did he use a standard surface web host
[2013-01-08 23:15:21] <AlooGobi> Soulseekah, an english phrase that amounts to 3301 using the table? Do I have any constraints? References?
[2013-01-08 23:15:39] <Tech1> 106.186.14.0/24 is done
[2013-01-08 23:15:55] <Tech1> *done on port 80 that is
[2013-01-08 23:16:20] <Tech1> Absence_: ease of use? linode takes like 3 minutes to go live after you register

[2013-01-08 23:19:52] <soulseekah> AlexanderTheGrey, we deduced that the server is still active, but shutdown
[2013-01-08 23:20:01] <AlexanderTheGrey> nice
[2013-01-08 23:20:22] <soulseekah> at least support was able to correleate the IP to an active profile
[2013-01-08 23:20:30] <soulseekah> thus the deduction, we could be wrong
[2013-01-08 23:20:36] <Lurker69> still doxing the  PM?
[2013-01-08 23:20:49] <Tech1> at .120:81 nothing yet
[2013-01-08 23:20:53] <soulseekah> why doxing? it was never about doxing
[2013-01-08 23:21:05] <soulseekah> it was about gaining a peek into the state of things
[2013-01-08 23:21:25] <Tech1> http://li528-110.members.linode.com:81/ someone check

[2013-01-08 23:22:16] <soulseekah> poor linode
[2013-01-08 23:22:19] <Lurker69> i dont think this will lead somwhere, people are doxing PMs at every fucking ARG, never successful though also this  ARG is about security and anonyity, you think the  guy used his name for renting a server?
[2013-01-08 23:22:22] <soulseekah> they're getting bombed
[2013-01-08 23:22:34] <Lurker69> but...
[2013-01-08 23:22:35] <soulseekah> Lurker69, again, it was never about doxing
[2013-01-08 23:22:45] <soulseekah> it was about finding out whetehr the server is even alive at all

[2013-01-08 23:23:06] <Absence_> welcome to nginx
[2013-01-08 23:23:18] <Lurker69> i am not against it  but... seriously do you think you can gat anythign about them from IP of hired server?
[2013-01-08 23:23:31] <Lurker69> but its all learning process
[2013-01-08 23:23:33] <soulseekah> Lurker69, don't you read what the goal was?
[2013-01-08 23:23:51] <soulseekah> maximum that we were hoping for was for support to switch it back on
[2013-01-08 23:23:56] <soulseekah> which unsurprisingly didn't happen
[2013-01-08 23:24:04] <soulseekah> there is no interest in doxing
[2013-01-08 23:24:14] <Lurker69> i know
[2013-01-08 23:24:32] <soulseekah> so what we thought we could get was - a. state of server, b. maybe get them to switch it on

[2013-01-09 00:04:19] <n_factor> yeah, thats what i was thinking
[2013-01-09 00:04:29] <Ymgve> but curiously enough they are two minutes apart in time
[2013-01-09 00:04:50] <soulseekah> the server contains a bunch of <SCRIPT SRC="http://ads.ozonemedia.com/ttj?id=1002026" TYPE="text/javascript"></SCRIPT> entries
[2013-01-09 00:05:01] <soulseekah> probably some ad server or logger
[2013-01-09 00:05:03] <n_factor> did you check the .img file for non-allocated data?
[2013-01-09 00:05:20] <Tech1> yeah, would make sense to do that too
[2013-01-09 00:05:21] <Ymgve> so have you found the correct server or are you fucking around in some totally unrelated guys' machines
[2013-01-09 00:05:37] <Ymgve> n_factor: nope, but I don't think cpio has much space for non-allocated data
[2013-01-09 00:05:48] <Ymgve> I did a scan of the full iso without finding anything
[2013-01-09 00:05:50] <soulseekah> Ymgve, the latter, unfortunately
[2013-01-09 00:06:24] <Tech1> Ymgve: tried to connect to the whole subnet on both :80 and :81 that the VPS was on, hoping to hit the 1st onion site
[2013-01-09 00:06:30] <soulseekah> only subnet is related, there was a theory that onion1 was in the same subnet
[2013-01-09 00:06:34] <Tech1> and who knows, maybe we did
[2013-01-09 00:06:44] <Tech1> but it didn't display as expected
[2013-01-09 00:06:50] <indigo_> Ymgve : http://i.imgur.com/Tywuz.png What is that  a picture of?
[2013-01-09 00:06:52] <soulseekah> the theory still stands, but takes up too much time
[2013-01-09 00:07:06] <Ymgve> indigo_: it's 7zip with the 3301.IMG file open
[2013-01-09 00:07:21] <Ymgve> it shows the only files where the dates are different from the other files
[2013-01-09 00:08:15] <AlexanderTheGrey> what do the txt files say?
[2013-01-09 00:08:25] <Tech1> yeah. soul, any idea what language for the shell on the 1st onion?
[2013-01-09 00:08:33] <soulseekah> Tech1, language?!
[2013-01-09 00:08:42] <soulseekah> AlexanderTheGrey, txt files?
[2013-01-09 00:08:42] <Tech1> ..what it was written in?
[2013-01-09 00:08:43] <indigo_> Ymgve, this one 3301.iso/BOOT/3301.img? or the file inside it?
[2013-01-09 00:08:50] <soulseekah> Tech1, no idea
[2013-01-09 00:08:56] <Ymgve> indigo_: the file inside it
[2013-01-09 00:08:59] <AlexanderTheGrey> message.txt
[2013-01-09 00:09:07] <Tech1> hm, just thinking out loud.
[2013-01-09 00:09:08] <Ymgve> 3301 is a cpio image compressed with gzip
[2013-01-09 00:09:25] <Ymgve> 3301.IMG I mean
[2013-01-09 00:09:29] <soulseekah> gunzip img | cpio --extract
[2013-01-09 00:09:36] <n_factor> well, extracted the files take up 8,147,104 bytes. The .img is 8,324,608.  thats 180k.  Think its all taken up by filesystem structures and block stubs beyond eof?
[2013-01-09 00:09:46] <indigo_> Ymgve : Mine doesn't have any message.txt, just a buch of folders

[2013-01-09 00:18:53] <Guest3301> Tech1: probably not
[2013-01-09 00:18:57] <soulseekah> indigo_, you'll have to alter the ramdisk to activate some profiles
[2013-01-09 00:19:14] <soulseekah> indigo_, /etc/passwd, shadow etc. for it to drop a shell

[2013-01-09 00:19:35] <soulseekah> indigo_, it drops a prompt Ctrl+C at cicada program
[2013-01-09 00:19:50] <soulseekah> but we haven't been able to get in with the listed users in passwd
[2013-01-09 00:20:00] <Guest3301> soulseekah: /etc/passwd?
[2013-01-09 00:20:07] <soulseekah> you can create a new user, repackage and login with it
[2013-01-09 00:20:20] <soulseekah> but I doubt there will be anything interesting, that's why nobody has done it
[2013-01-09 00:20:23] <Tech1> isn't the old default unix password hash broken?

[2013-01-09 00:21:25] <indigo_> hash^ not right work
[2013-01-09 00:22:04] <soulseekah> just modify the relevant pass files, although I think I saw the tc user in sudoers without a prompt
[2013-01-09 00:22:13] <soulseekah> i.e. it wouldn't ask for root password
[2013-01-09 00:22:28] <soulseekah> I may be mistaken though, there were two users in sudoers file

[2013-01-09 00:29:48] <soulseekah> no no connections of course
[2013-01-09 00:29:54] <soulseekah> only 2 mounted devices
[2013-01-09 00:29:54] <Tech1> :(
[2013-01-09 00:30:13] <Tech1> default IP?
[2013-01-09 00:30:27] <soulseekah> no I think qemu gave me one
[2013-01-09 00:30:30] <n_factor> why are there 2 different boot option configurations?
[2013-01-09 00:30:31] <soulseekah> hold on let me check
[2013-01-09 00:30:34] <n_factor> that are identical
[2013-01-09 00:30:38] <bakpak2hvy> Tech1: what do you mean?
[2013-01-09 00:30:44] <n_factor> label boot and label mc
[2013-01-09 00:30:56] <Tech1> the default ip? you can specify an IP for a box.
[2013-01-09 00:31:06] <bakpak2hvy> like the loopback?
[2013-01-09 00:31:09] <bakpak2hvy> usually 127.0.0.1
[2013-01-09 00:31:15] <Tech1> maybe, some crazy chance, it was a non-local IP that we could pull up
[2013-01-09 00:31:16] <soulseekah> no there is an eth0 device up
[2013-01-09 00:31:23] <Tech1> just giving us additional clues sort of thing
[2013-01-09 00:31:23] <soulseekah> with 10.0.2.15
[2013-01-09 00:31:28] <soulseekah> but it's probably qemu's

[2013-01-09 00:36:39] <soulseekah> anything else ...
[2013-01-09 00:36:43] <soulseekah> still looking into devices
[2013-01-09 00:36:57] <Tech1> nothing i can think of

[2013-01-09 00:37:30] <AlooGobi> Wait, that was a lot of information. There is a directory of pages written with runes? And there's nothing that pertains to our search?
[2013-01-09 00:37:57] <Lurker69> AlooGobi: i think i posted links to runes converters (2 of them) in wiki one converter has also explanaztion where and when runes were in sue
[2013-01-09 00:38:50] <AlexanderTheGrey> any books about wisdom and folly written in runes, cicada does love literature

[2013-01-09 00:43:43] <n_factor> go start one absence. and post the 232 jpg there so i can grab it
[2013-01-09 00:44:13] <rr645> AlooGobi, should you find more coyote references, be aware that 'Coyote' was ANOTHER troll in last year's game
[2013-01-09 00:44:18] <Tech1> random observation: even if cicada canceled the 2nd onion account, it would probably still show as an active account until the start of next billing cycle
[2013-01-09 00:44:36] <soulseekah> who knows, that's why it's just an assumption
[2013-01-09 00:44:45] <n_factor> where did you find the coyote reference?
[2013-01-09 00:44:48] <Tech1> yeah, just commenting outloud i suppose

[2013-01-09 01:21:59] <soulseekah> onion1 is certainly responding to connection requests on all ports fast, but onion2 time out all the time
[2013-01-09 01:22:24] <soulseekah> so the tor service router behind onion2 is off of tor
[2013-01-09 01:23:01] <n_factor> hi
[2013-01-09 01:23:28] <n_factor> Do you think it would be advantageous to write a script to read a file and output files in reverse format outputting data in 1, 8, and 16 bit words.
[2013-01-09 01:23:38] <n_factor> so 1 file makes 3 files, reversed
[2013-01-09 01:24:05] <perplexed> fixed it a bit
[2013-01-09 01:24:09] <soulseekah> no idea, at the moment not sure what we can do to our advantage

[2013-01-09 01:24:24] <n_factor> 0A1B2C would come back in its binary reversal, C2B1A0, and 2C1B0A
[2013-01-09 01:24:31] <perplexed> i don't know exactly where the onions links were derived from so i could make a seperate page for that and whats going on in tor

[2013-01-09 01:24:47] <soulseekah> byte order
[2013-01-09 01:24:51] <n_factor> since there is so much in the game about reading data in reverse
[2013-01-09 01:25:06] <soulseekah> have we read anything in reverse yet?
[2013-01-09 01:25:12] <n_factor> i think i'll write a script to do it hold on
[2013-01-09 01:25:15] <soulseekah> except the palindromes
[2013-01-09 01:26:54] <n_factor> the primes that are also primes in reverse have special significance in the count program
[2013-01-09 01:27:10] <n_factor> all the primes in the parable are like that
[2013-01-09 01:27:20] <n_factor> as well as the gematria of "Patience is a virtue."
[2013-01-09 01:27:53] <AlooGobi> Patience is a virtue comes out as a prime number that is parable?
[2013-01-09 01:27:58] <n_factor> also, there are areas of the .mp3 which are guitar chords played backwards
[2013-01-09 01:28:07] <n_factor> yes. 761
[2013-01-09 01:28:18] <n_factor> 167 is prime as well
[2013-01-09 01:28:29] <n_factor> when you "count Patience is a virtue."
[2013-01-09 01:28:34] <perplexed> whats the chord progression n factor?
[2013-01-09 01:30:03] <indigo_> Just so you all remeber 167 is the length in seconds of the .mp3
[2013-01-09 01:30:41] <n_factor> there is are 3 notes played backwards at about 11.4 s to 9.9 s

[2013-01-09 01:30:59] <n_factor> 11.4 s to 21.3 s

[2013-01-09 01:31:44] <AlooGobi> 99 aint prime
[2013-01-09 01:31:51] <n_factor> you hear it gradually get louder as the decay is reversed
[2013-01-09 01:32:01] <n_factor> then a sudden quick one that has reverse decay
[2013-01-09 01:32:09] <AlooGobi> right, you guys put it in audacity right?
[2013-01-09 01:32:09] <n_factor> then a real short note with reverse decay

[2013-01-09 01:32:45] <n_factor> so some of the notes in the mp3 are backwards
[2013-01-09 01:32:55] <n_factor> thats all i'm saying
[2013-01-09 01:33:05] <n_factor> that alot of these things in the game are looked at in reverse
[2013-01-09 01:33:07] <AlooGobi> Yea, that's cool. I noticed that too
[2013-01-09 01:33:31] <AlooGobi> I think there's some backing to that. I think we'll be finding it quite soon
[2013-01-09 01:33:37] <n_factor> also, the [number] function will check for factors, and if the number is prime, it checks for factors of the number reversed
[2013-01-09 01:34:01] <n_factor> so alot of things in the game indicate that we should look at things both forward and backwards
[2013-01-09 01:34:40] <n_factor> so 02 comes out with factors 2 2 5
[2013-01-09 01:34:45] <n_factor> because 2 is prime, but 20 is not

[2013-01-09 01:37:17] <n_factor> do you think there is data in the hiss from about 0.6 to 4.1 sec?
[2013-01-09 01:37:45] <n_factor> or do you think its just supposed to sound like cicadas chirping
[2013-01-09 01:38:04] <AlooGobi> What does static usually have? The only maleable piece of data is amplitude... but that's not too useful
[2013-01-09 01:38:21] <soulseekah> n_factor, if you're looking for data good place to start is 500Hz notches at minute 1:00
[2013-01-09 01:38:23] <AlooGobi> It's probably just cicadas

[2013-01-09 01:44:15] <AlooGobi> I'm no expert but with such a shitty microphone, would it be able to pick up the large range of the guitar? there wasn't a point where the guitar was above the mics threshhold.
[2013-01-09 01:44:26] <n_factor> i found a noise fingerprint that starts at 2 seconds and plays through to the end of the guitar, it starts half way through the hiss at the beginning
[2013-01-09 01:44:40] <soulseekah> AlooGobi, I think he refered to the 15.6-16.4kHz line noise
[2013-01-09 01:44:43] <n_factor> so yeah, its definatly multi track
[2013-01-09 01:45:12] <AlooGobi> I'm referring to the whole track
[2013-01-09 01:45:21] <n_factor> the guitar was recorded in stereo, the tracks differ slightly.

[2013-01-09 02:01:14] <Kokosnuss> nvm
[2013-01-09 02:01:15] <Kokosnuss> got it
[2013-01-09 02:01:20] <soulseekah> next
[2013-01-09 02:01:25] <soulseekah> if you select both
[2013-01-09 02:01:27] <soulseekah> and Mix and render
[2013-01-09 02:01:33] <soulseekah> you get a nice track back
[2013-01-09 02:01:38] <soulseekah> let me paste the stereogram
[2013-01-09 02:01:55] <n_factor> the black triangle V in the track dialog has split stereo to mono

[2013-01-09 02:03:32] <soulseekah> notice how noise at 15.5kHz changed too with distinct notches
[2013-01-09 02:03:44] <soulseekah> and there's actually sort of an image
[2013-01-09 02:03:49] <AlooGobi> right... I just get a quieter piece though.
[2013-01-09 02:04:33] <soulseekah> look I'll show you
[2013-01-09 02:04:37] <AlooGobi> Sure
[2013-01-09 02:04:39] <soulseekah> http://www.anony.ws/i/2013/01/09/y7Avz.png
[2013-01-09 02:04:43] <soulseekah> see these patterns?
[2013-01-09 02:04:50] <soulseekah> these appeared after cancellation
[2013-01-09 02:05:10] <soulseekah> and they're pretty patterny from 0:02 to 0:59
[2013-01-09 02:05:20] <AlooGobi> I see, I see
[2013-01-09 02:05:23] <AlooGobi> hmmm
[2013-01-09 02:05:25] <Grazza> nice
[2013-01-09 02:05:30] <Kokosnuss> 59 being prime?
[2013-01-09 02:05:33] <Daffodilianv> Definitely
[2013-01-09 02:05:50] <indigo_> same with 2
[2013-01-09 02:05:57] <AlooGobi> wat
[2013-01-09 02:05:58] <Kokosnuss> mhmmm
[2013-01-09 02:06:03] <soulseekah> another thing I think is that the noise has to be isolated, pitch shfited down
[2013-01-09 02:06:04] <AlooGobi> ^
[2013-01-09 02:06:08] <soulseekah> to reveal speech probably
[2013-01-09 02:06:13] <soulseekah> it looks like a speech wavefomr
[2013-01-09 02:06:18] <indigo_> I'm going to replace some colors in photoshop and see if I can make the picture more viewable
[2013-01-09 02:06:24] <soulseekah> trying to figurie out whether there's actually enough bandwidth for that
[2013-01-09 02:06:25] <Kokosnuss> Would they let us hear their voice?
[2013-01-09 02:06:32] <soulseekah> Kokosnuss, synth of course
[2013-01-09 02:06:41] <AlooGobi> Well they use the robot voice
[2013-01-09 02:06:48] <Kokosnuss> Duh *facepalm*
[2013-01-09 02:07:00] <Daffodilianv> It definitely has the pauses for speech
[2013-01-09 02:07:03] <soulseekah> there is really tons of shit in that stereogram
[2013-01-09 02:07:09] <soulseekah> lots of holes and voids
[2013-01-09 02:07:10] <Daffodilianv> But it seems rather similar
[2013-01-09 02:07:15] <soulseekah> let me do more screenshots

[2013-01-09 02:13:08] <soulseekah> Lurker69, here's stuff I found http://www.anony.ws/i/2013/01/09/y7Avz.png by mocking around
[2013-01-09 02:13:19] <soulseekah> did you guys look trhough those patterns?
[2013-01-09 02:13:31] <n_factor> there is a notch filter in audacity
[2013-01-09 02:13:41] <n_factor> i want a notch pass filter
[2013-01-09 02:13:42] <Lurker69> this is cicada mp3?
[2013-01-09 02:13:44] <soulseekah> n_factor, as long as you know what you want to filter
[2013-01-09 02:13:48] <soulseekah> Lurker69, indeed it is
[2013-01-09 02:13:48] <n_factor> to isolate a specific frequency
[2013-01-09 02:13:58] <n_factor> its doing the reverse of what i want
[2013-01-09 02:14:08] <soulseekah> n_factor, isolate the noise 15-17kHz and amplify
[2013-01-09 02:14:10] <n_factor> its cutting out the frequency band i want
[2013-01-09 02:14:12] <soulseekah> see if it whispers anything
[2013-01-09 02:14:20] <soulseekah> it should
[2013-01-09 02:14:21] <AlooGobi> zoom and enhance
[2013-01-09 02:14:32] <soulseekah> I'm approaching this visually since I have no sound atm
[2013-01-09 02:15:22] <soulseekah> http://www.anony.ws/i/2013/01/09/x3Tr1.png it does certainly look as if therey's something scribbled
[2013-01-09 02:15:30] <sephiap> ahh back to the song, I spent way too many hours trying to find stuff in the waveforms
[2013-01-09 02:15:36] <soulseekah> but zooming in just those notches
[2013-01-09 02:15:48] <Lurker69> that lines at 5k looks like it might be some morse like code... but it is not much
[2013-01-09 02:15:54] <sephiap> has any one tried echo hiding retrieval?
[2013-01-09 02:16:02] <indigo_> I messing with some color replacing, whats a good site to upload my images to?
[2013-01-09 02:16:10] <soulseekah> indigo_, use anony.ws
[2013-01-09 02:16:31] <soulseekah> it's at 15k the noise one

[2013-01-09 02:19:06] <indigo_> That black puts better contrast to the lite blue
[2013-01-09 02:19:15] <soulseekah> no actually ps won't help here

[2013-01-09 02:20:46] <soulseekah> around the 50-60 seconds marks
[2013-01-09 02:20:47] <indigo_> Guys, look at the pink area above the yellow on the right and zoom in,  I can see something that looks like letters http://www.anony.ws/i/2013/01/09/XrucW.png
[2013-01-09 02:20:52] <Lurker69> only zook in ok
[2013-01-09 02:21:02] <soulseekah> it's a vertical only zoom in
[2013-01-09 02:21:24] <soulseekah> indigo_, you have to be more specific

[2013-01-09 02:32:57] <soulseekah> this is the noise from 15kHz, isolated and pitchshifted to 6k
[2013-01-09 02:33:02] <soulseekah> which should be pretty audible

[2013-01-09 02:33:25] <Ixateht> hey, i'm new here.  don't want to sidetrack you all. i've been working through all the steps myself, using the wiki for guidance, but wanting to reproduce each step myself.  i found the tabs and spaces in the "white space" outguess message from the primus jpg, but i'm not sure what the wiki means by converting to binary and back to ascii.  can someone give me a bit more explanation?

[2013-01-09 02:35:04] <AlooGobi> :(
[2013-01-09 02:35:04] <AlooGobi> keep at it
[2013-01-09 02:35:05] <indigo_> Lurker69 : are you telling me to, or telling me you did?
[2013-01-09 02:35:14] <perplexed> omg
[2013-01-09 02:35:54] <Lurker69> i dont have audiocity here
[2013-01-09 02:36:35] <Lurker69> cant do dspectograms, i have only one spactrolab that  is wy to coplicated for my poor audio knwledge
[2013-01-09 02:37:11] <Tech1> What brought about the sudden re-look of the audio?
[2013-01-09 02:37:34] <Lurker69> who was the guy studding music in channel yesterday
[2013-01-09 02:38:05] <soulseekah> Tech1, n_factor and AlooGobi started looking at it again
[2013-01-09 02:38:06] <perplexed> grazza was tabbing it out
[2013-01-09 02:38:26] <Tech1> Hm, fair enough
[2013-01-09 02:38:29] <perplexed> i study a bit nothing too advanced yet
[2013-01-09 02:39:14] <Lurker69> guy yesterday recognized drums in cong, he used some word for the drums i have never herd of before
[2013-01-09 02:39:37] <Tech1> out of curiosity, #1: anyone remember if there is a min. password length on truecrypt? And #2 what the smallest size file you can encrypt is? ...just random thoughts..
[2013-01-09 02:39:44] <indigo_> Lurker69: what did you mean by this > indigo_: make zoom in of that notches iat 1:50 http://prntscr.com/okpx4
[2013-01-09 02:40:08] <perplexed> what did he call them lurker?
[2013-01-09 02:40:43] <Grazza> hmm
[2013-01-09 02:40:55] <Grazza> cosmo was the one tabbing it out
[2013-01-09 02:41:01] <Grazza> the guitar part
[2013-01-09 02:41:06] <Lurker69> can you make spectogram  only of 10 seconds streched through  width of the screen...  like making more samples in less time
[2013-01-09 02:41:22] <soulseekah> sure, which seconds though?
[2013-01-09 02:41:32] <soulseekah> and remember I'm working with the phase-inverted version
[2013-01-09 02:41:37] <soulseekah> with the cicada scream gone
[2013-01-09 02:41:45] <Lurker69> around 1:50 is that part with three notches
[2013-01-09 02:41:50] <indigo_> Lurker69  : I don't know how to make spectograms, I was just editing one that someone else uploaded, I can take the pic you linked and change the zoom on it
[2013-01-09 02:41:52] <AlooGobi> http://anony.ws/i/2013/01/09/5hIkG.png is what the 15k zoomed in looks like
[2013-01-09 02:42:09] <AlooGobi> maybe hebrew if you were desperate but nothing really
[2013-01-09 02:42:18] <AlooGobi> That's with no alterations
[2013-01-09 02:43:07] <Tech1> Is it normal for high freq audio to look that...sharp and well defined?
[2013-01-09 02:43:20] <Lurker69> soulseekah: i dint hear anything in your mp3 on anonfiles
[2013-01-09 02:43:43] <AlooGobi> When there isn't alot of sound for it to draw, it will draw straight and defined lines
[2013-01-09 02:43:49] <AlooGobi> so yeas
[2013-01-09 02:43:50] <Tech1> ahh
[2013-01-09 02:44:07] <soulseekah> Lurker69, ok
[2013-01-09 02:44:26] <perplexed> aloogobi, can you sharpen that?
[2013-01-09 02:45:18] <n_factor> i hear alot of reverse decay in the high peak part with the drums in it
[2013-01-09 02:45:18] <Tech1> Alright ,im going to try and sleep again.
[2013-01-09 02:45:21] <n_factor> when i listen to the file
[2013-01-09 02:45:27] <indigo_> soulseekah : There is high piched hissing/the sound of a valve turning and shreaking throughout the entire mp3
[2013-01-09 02:45:31] <n_factor> i wonder if we can isolate that
[2013-01-09 02:45:35] <Lurker69> [2013-01-07 11:32:05] <Cosmo_> The  reversed music at the end is not in the same key as the rest of the song, the song was one guitar recorded by two microphones, the drums at the end are only one bass drum heavily edited.
[2013-01-09 02:46:00] <soulseekah> why two microphones?
[2013-01-09 02:46:11] <Tech1> dont mics record mono?
[2013-01-09 02:46:13] <AlooGobi> The high shreeking is a back ground hiss, often with shitty mics, you get that.
[2013-01-09 02:46:22] <soulseekah> this doesn't even have to be recorded
[2013-01-09 02:46:26] <soulseekah> merely assembled
[2013-01-09 02:46:32] <indigo_> AlooGobi : Alright, so then there is no real sound in the recording
[2013-01-09 02:46:33] <Lurker69> <Cosmo_> While I don't like to talk about myself all that much, I'm at university studying music technology.
[2013-01-09 02:46:41] <AlooGobi> they do, but most mics now adays record in stereo because there are to mics in the casing
[2013-01-09 02:46:54] <Tech1> Hm fair enough.
[2013-01-09 02:47:01] <AlooGobi> Indigo : define "real"
[2013-01-09 02:47:42] <AlooGobi> right, yea, this may be a set of midi files, where a computer generates the sound. this may be an assembly of individual guitar notes taken from a list
[2013-01-09 02:47:47] <Tech1> Is it normal for ARGs to get in your head like this?
[2013-01-09 02:48:09] <AlooGobi> keeps me thinknig about it. Soul hasn't worked for two days because of it
[2013-01-09 02:48:24] <soulseekah> 8AM here
[2013-01-09 02:48:25] <indigo_> AlooGobi : Stuff that matters to the game
[2013-01-09 02:48:29] <soulseekah> 2 days no sleep, no work
[2013-01-09 02:48:51] <Tech1> I keep thinking as well. But i blow things up for a living, i do have to sleep. Haha

[2013-01-09 02:50:32] <soulseekah> I figured if an address can have multiple virtual ports why not scan them all
[2013-01-09 02:50:42] <soulseekah> maybe theres something else on that address
[2013-01-09 02:50:43] <AlooGobi> thats pretty awesome tech

[2013-01-09 02:51:16] <AlooGobi> that doesn't make it okay

[2013-01-09 02:54:12] <Grazza> we have a riddle which we never solved
[2013-01-09 02:54:13] <AlooGobi> There has to be a reason why

[2013-01-09 02:54:17] <AlooGobi> which one?
[2013-01-09 02:54:31] <AlooGobi> which riddle?
[2013-01-09 02:54:54] <AlooGobi> WHICH RIDDDLE
[2013-01-09 02:55:05] <soulseekah> Forest and the trees
[2013-01-09 02:55:14] <AlooGobi> lol i figured that out,
[2013-01-09 02:55:31] <AlooGobi> It just means you're looking at the details too much. You should look at the bigger picture
[2013-01-09 02:55:37] <soulseekah> really?
[2013-01-09 02:55:42] <AlooGobi> your looking at the trees, instead of the whole forest
[2013-01-09 02:55:48] <soulseekah> ..
[2013-01-09 02:55:49] <AlooGobi> Yea I've heard the phrase before
[2013-01-09 02:56:03] <Tech1> Im not quite convinced thats it.
[2013-01-09 02:56:14] <AlooGobi> Google it
[2013-01-09 02:56:31] <soulseekah> AlooGobi, everyone knows what it means on the outside
[2013-01-09 02:56:40] <soulseekah> but there's got to be more on the inside
[2013-01-09 02:56:41] <AlooGobi> its an idiom...

[2013-01-09 03:08:42] <soulseekah> it was taken down because the hostname was leaked probably

[2013-01-09 03:13:52] <Kokosnuss> The book. It seems that, because it was used once before, and since there weren't any references to hint towards a different place for "wisdom" or "folly", it's more likely it would be from something we've used

[2013-01-09 03:56:12] <soulseekah> if one sees those bytes in some of the files, then xoring from that offset will yield the soughtafter result

[2013-01-09 04:04:56] <soulseekah> that is looking for something to xor with
[2013-01-09 04:05:07] <soulseekah> since we don't know what to use on these files, we have to find something that would work
[2013-01-09 04:05:13] <perplexed> and then run it through all combinations
[2013-01-09 04:05:13] <soulseekah> those bytes up there is a shortlist
[2013-01-09 04:05:33] <soulseekah> if you see those bytes in any of the files we have then they can be used to get a PNG, PGP or JPG from wisdom/folly
[2013-01-09 04:05:41] <soulseekah> assuming that wisdom/folly is one of the above
[2013-01-09 04:05:48] <soulseekah> and not an mp3 for example
[2013-01-09 04:05:50] <soulseekah> or a gif
[2013-01-09 04:06:17] <perplexed> ymgve said that there wasn't anything extra in the twitter
[2013-01-09 04:06:28] <perplexed> but wasn't there something strange in it?
[2013-01-09 04:06:28] <soulseekah> this is not relevant
[2013-01-09 04:06:34] <perplexed> ok
[2013-01-09 04:06:54] <soulseekah> we're looking for bytes in a file to satisfy the condition
[2013-01-09 04:07:05] <soulseekah> of folly being either a PNG a PGP or a JPG when xored
[2013-01-09 04:07:16] <soulseekah> look at all the files and find those byte sequences
[2013-01-09 04:07:28] <perplexed> no idea how to go about that, or which files to go through
[2013-01-09 04:08:02] <soulseekah> find file (DATA, iso, any of the images, anything) dump hex, search for bytes
[2013-01-09 04:08:11] <soulseekah> if none found, move to next file
[2013-01-09 04:08:37] <soulseekah> again this is assuming that wisdom is either a JPG a PNG or starts with ----BEGIN... i.e. a PGP message like we've been seeing
[2013-01-09 04:09:17] <dalegora> Kokosnuss, sorry but i don't think that was me.
[2013-01-09 04:09:17] <lulzorz> I think it's most likely to be PGP based on the 3k size
[2013-01-09 04:09:24] <lulzorz> or maybe small png
[2013-01-09 04:09:35] <lulzorz> (or jpg)
[2013-01-09 04:09:35] <soulseekah> lulzorz, that is a good ovservation
[2013-01-09 04:09:42] <soulseekah> most likely a PGP
[2013-01-09 04:10:59] <Kokosnuss> Ok
[2013-01-09 04:11:29] <soulseekah> then again it could be base64 encoded
[2013-01-09 04:11:42] <soulseekah> which would change the needed bytes
[2013-01-09 04:11:50] <soulseekah> but we can calculate those too

[2013-01-09 04:16:56] <soulseekah> for the base64
[2013-01-09 04:28:53] <soulseekah> it could also be hidden inside of somethign already xord
[2013-01-09 04:29:04] <soulseekah> like xor two files in the data against one another
[2013-01-09 04:29:27] <soulseekah> then xor with wisdom, so bytes have to be found in the prevoius xor
[2013-01-09 04:30:24] <Kokosnuss> So, did anything ever come of the text (supposedly) hidden in the mp3
[2013-01-09 04:31:47] <Lurker69> http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/What_We_Know wiki pretty much up to date

[2013-01-09 04:33:27] <soulseekah> I've pretty much gone searched all the DATA files, the images, and the mp3
[2013-01-09 04:33:32] <soulseekah> stil lcan't find those bytes
[2013-01-09 04:33:33] <Lurker69> or it can be xored thre times, like mp3 with 560; then xored again with folly
[2013-01-09 04:33:40] <soulseekah> correct
[2013-01-09 04:33:57] <soulseekah> so I will not proceed to xor everything with everything and see if I can find those bytes
[2013-01-09 04:34:08] <Lurker69> there are quite few combinations if you include posibiliti of three times xoring or eve foru times

[2013-01-09 04:37:22] <soulseekah> Lurker69, xor is used in one time pad
[2013-01-09 04:37:27] <soulseekah> and that link contains an example
[2013-01-09 04:37:33] <soulseekah> that's why I pointed it out
[2013-01-09 04:37:42] <Lurker69> i will check
[2013-01-09 04:38:06] <soulseekah> or better http://www.bestinternetsecurity.net/94/xor-and-the-one-time-pad.html
[2013-01-09 04:38:14] <soulseekah> this is less fidgety
[2013-01-09 04:39:25] <Lurker69> The classical one-time pad of espionage used actual pads of minuscule, easily concealed paper, a sharp pencil, and some mental arithmetic. The method can be implemented now as a software program, using data files as input (plaintext), output (ciphertext) and key material (the required random sequence). The XOR operation is often used to combine the plaintext and the key elements, and is...
[2013-01-09 04:39:25] <Lurker69> ...especially attractive on computers
[2013-01-09 04:39:43] <soulseekah> all this xoring is becoming more and more guesswork
[2013-01-09 04:39:51] <soulseekah> as what is know is eliminated
[2013-01-09 04:39:58] <AlooGobi> Okay, so its a cipher. So what cicada is giving us ciphertext. We are converting it back to plaintext?
[2013-01-09 04:40:00] <Lurker69> there are two  main OTP ciphers... paper and pen one (no xor) and computer one (xor) to make it harder
[2013-01-09 04:40:29] <soulseekah> can't be guessing and bruteforcing so much
[2013-01-09 04:40:32] <Kokosnuss> Basically
[2013-01-09 04:40:38] <soulseekah> last 24 hours has been nothing but bf and guesswork
[2013-01-09 04:40:56] <Lurker69> but typical OnE Time Pag  is cipher  on paper that doesnt contain xor  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2226203/Skeleton-hero-World-War-II-carrier-pigeon-chimney-secret-coded-message-attached-leg.html
[2013-01-09 04:41:22] <soulseekah> not all otp is xor but all xor is otp
[2013-01-09 04:41:23] <rr645> There's got to be something we can still apply brainpower to, though--3301's not going to leave us checking every file we've ever found without any clues
[2013-01-09 04:41:36] <soulseekah> rr645, exactly my point
[2013-01-09 04:42:05] <rr645> But that leaves us…what, exactly? The music, perhaps?
[2013-01-09 04:42:06] <soulseekah> we can't be expected to xor something n times with omething else n times

[2013-01-09 04:44:04] <soulseekah> should add up to 3301

[2013-01-09 04:45:50] <soulseekah> Lurker69, thing is that it's not an anagram/signle word I think
[2013-01-09 04:45:54] <iIIustrious> that would take some processing
[2013-01-09 04:46:06] <soulseekah> it has to be pretty substantial - around 10-15 words
[2013-01-09 04:46:16] <soulseekah> to go up to 3301
[2013-01-09 04:47:23] <Lurker69> yeah but you just add numbers from table tagater and  they have to matsh 3301, then you have to chack for every positive combination if it matches dictionary....  bit complicated yes

[2013-01-09 04:52:16] <soulseekah> it's not signed

[2013-01-09 04:52:31] <soulseekah> so assume irrelevant
[2013-01-09 04:52:35] <Lurker69> that was posted on 4th
[2013-01-09 04:52:44] <indigo_> No PGP = Ovious troll
[2013-01-09 04:52:44] <Lurker69> puzzzle bagan on 5th
[2013-01-09 04:53:11] <Lurker69> but  that thread was relevant because of religious long pastebin
[2013-01-09 04:53:29] <Lurker69> whoever made it knew about cicada starting puzzle next daya
[2013-01-09 04:54:06] <soulseekah> Lurker69, maybe 3301 was out earlier
[2013-01-09 04:54:17] <soulseekah> twitter was ready on the 31st of Dec for example
[2013-01-09 04:54:22] <soulseekah> judging by user reg. date
[2013-01-09 04:54:29] <Lurker69> dont think so
[2013-01-09 04:54:34] <soulseekah> iso was also done earlier
[2013-01-09 04:54:43] <indigo_> The img file inside the iso has file sigs from dec 27/21 idk which
[2013-01-09 04:54:56] <Lurker69> in that thread from 4th there isnt any new cicada message, it begins with ine from last yearž
[2013-01-09 04:55:14] <soulseekah> yes true

[2013-01-09 04:55:22] <Lurker69> try to outguess it maybe it  is different thna year before
[2013-01-09 04:55:25] <indigo_> Lurker69 : pretty big coincidence that it happened on the day before the new one
[2013-01-09 04:55:31] <Lurker69> ^
[2013-01-09 04:55:51] <Lurker69> and it containde pastebin from former "former" member
[2013-01-09 04:56:25] <Lurker69> and thread was alive for so long, some people were prepared to bump it, they had all the images form  previous year prepared

[2013-01-09 04:56:33] <soulseekah> then original first contact was x-posted from elsewhere
[2013-01-09 04:57:10] <soulseekah> in any case, what's the relevance of this again?
[2013-01-09 04:57:16] <soulseekah> whether Mandelbrot is authentic?

[2013-01-09 04:58:37] <absolutezeroff> how are we?
[2013-01-09 04:59:12] <soulseekah> same old
[2013-01-09 04:59:14] <Kokosnuss> I translated the forest hint using the rune list into numbers. Mostly to feel like I was doing something. I'm not sure what to do with the numbers. Add them to get a giant number, idk
[2013-01-09 04:59:27] <soulseekah> Kokosnuss, use Putty and connect to the console
[2013-01-09 04:59:32] <absolutezeroff> oh i'm at home now i can telnet
[2013-01-09 04:59:36] <Kokosnuss> ok
[2013-01-09 04:59:43] <soulseekah> Kokosnuss, it has a count command
[2013-01-09 04:59:49] <soulseekah> doing the job for you
[2013-01-09 04:59:59] <soulseekah> counting them up using the table is suicide
[2013-01-09 05:00:06] <soulseekah> same as xoring using pencil and paper
[2013-01-09 05:00:16] <Kokosnuss> So I type in the .onion address on port 80, right?
[2013-01-09 05:00:25] <soulseekah> Kokosnuss, yes, through tor
[2013-01-09 05:00:47] <Kokosnuss> I thought I wasn't using tor for that, but telnet
[2013-01-09 05:01:01] <soulseekah> it goes thorugh tor
[2013-01-09 05:01:38] <soulseekah> maybe I should expose a netcat connection over http for those lacking tor
[2013-01-09 05:01:51] <soulseekah> but not now, it's 10AM and haven't slept yet
[2013-01-09 05:02:06] <Kokosnuss> I'm thoroughly lost. Can I pm you real quick?
[2013-01-09 05:02:21] <soulseekah> sure
[2013-01-09 05:02:49] <soulseekah> easiest people have found to do is get VirtualBox and use Tails
[2013-01-09 05:03:14] <soulseekah> it had "torify" out of the box, netcat  etc.

[2013-01-09 05:09:03] <flumentia> so have we tried to take the missing primes and turn them into runes?

[2013-01-09 05:11:30] <soulseekah> flumentia, by guessing their words?
[2013-01-09 05:11:36] <rr645> flumentia taking large numbers and turning them into Gematria letters would produce a very broad range of results, I'm afraid.
[2013-01-09 05:11:38] <soulseekah> there are 180 primes missing
[2013-01-09 05:11:54] <soulseekah> that's at least 180 words then
[2013-01-09 05:12:22] <soulseekah> it's not concrete enough
[2013-01-09 05:13:14] <AlooGobi> what if you add all those primes together?

[2013-01-09 05:13:37] <soulseekah> AlooGobi, a number is not enought at this point
[2013-01-09 05:13:48] <soulseekah> it seems, we need somethign more substantial
[2013-01-09 05:14:30] <absolutezeroff> heh wonder why it was called 232.jpg
[2013-01-09 05:14:31] <soulseekah> let's see if I can code a count for those of you without counters

[2013-01-09 05:40:50] <crash_demons> I'm still not sure how the count code works unless it reads two in at a time (advance 1)
[2013-01-09 05:41:06] <soulseekah> crash_demons, I used a simple serach and replace
[2013-01-09 05:41:15] <soulseekah> substituting things like ea for one symbol
[2013-01-09 05:41:19] <soulseekah> then loookup
[2013-01-09 05:41:20] <crash_demons> soulseekah, that could potentially produce errors.
[2013-01-09 05:41:38] <soulseekah> let's find them
[2013-01-09 05:41:43] <soulseekah> http://codeseekah.com/cicada/count.html
[2013-01-09 05:41:49] <soulseekah> source is there, all is straightforward
[2013-01-09 05:41:52] <crash_demons> I mean, invalid results
[2013-01-09 05:42:04] <soulseekah> first lowercase all, then substitute doubles and triples for uppercase specials
[2013-01-09 05:42:09] <soulseekah> then lookup all the things
[2013-01-09 05:42:14] <AlooGobi> Pangaea comes up as 417 on the count, but by hand is 392
[2013-01-09 05:42:15] <soulseekah> it's pretty straightforward
[2013-01-09 05:42:25] <rr645> The choice of futhark makes this eminently more complex, but there must be a reason to use the runic and not latin alphabet
[2013-01-09 05:42:30] <soulseekah> AlooGobi, pangaea comes ups as 417 in the onion1 console
[2013-01-09 05:42:48] <AlooGobi> must be my mistake then...

[2013-01-09 05:53:01] <AlooGobi> they may have put in alternatives as mercy ?
[2013-01-09 05:53:15] <scrounger> looks like they went by sound. which makes sense
[2013-01-09 05:53:16] <crash_demons> okay, I guess it's the same as what 3301 is doing

[2013-01-09 05:54:00] <Lurker69> The Anglo-Saxon rune poem
[2013-01-09 05:54:05] <scrounger> looking at this on wiki, it seems like this was the first alphabet used to write english language
[2013-01-09 05:54:08] <Lurker69> ok its not futhark then
[2013-01-09 05:54:10] <scrounger> primus is first in latin.
[2013-01-09 05:54:18] <scrounger> so, that starts making sense.
[2013-01-09 05:54:25] <Lurker69> primus is probably prime
[2013-01-09 05:54:34] <rr645> Yes, primus can mean 'prime' in latin
[2013-01-09 05:54:48] <Lurker69> every letter has prime number at it
[2013-01-09 05:55:10] <AlooGobi> but the numbers are added on by cicada
[2013-01-09 05:55:17] <AlooGobi> bear no history to the language
[2013-01-09 05:56:03] <crash_demons> I wonder if the "get" command was originally intended to allow a sort of half-ass way to use a browser to access it
[2013-01-09 05:56:21] <scrounger> right. but if you look up the latin definition of "primus" it is, literally "first."  since there's pretty much no coincidences with cicada, I assume that this means something
[2013-01-09 05:56:27] <scrounger> also, read this section: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English#Latin_influence

[2013-01-09 05:57:26] <scrounger> "Often, the Latin alphabet fell short of being able to adequately represent Anglo-Saxon phonetics. Spellings, therefore, can be thought of as best-attempt approximations of how the language actually sounded."
[2013-01-09 05:57:52] <soulseekah> crash_demons, it reacts to as little as "get http" to close connection (partial GET / HTTP/1.x), does not react to all other HTTP verbs; has a peculiar bug wherein getting a file with an extension (js, txt, etc.) actually falls through to the shell.
[2013-01-09 05:58:04] <scrounger> so it makes sense that they converted english to the latin alphabet by sound. that explains a lot of the weird combinations

[2013-01-09 06:28:51] <rr645> Assuming there are no coincidences while wildly generate massive amounts of numbers may get you pretty far off track
[2013-01-09 06:30:00] <Lurker69> but we have to try  as many posibilities as we can
[2013-01-09 06:31:11] <Lurker69> someone will eventually got the idea waht to do with console
[2013-01-09 06:31:30] <Lurker69> i think we didnt xord all the posibilities yet
[2013-01-09 06:31:59] <crash_demons> the 41st prime number is 179* btw
[2013-01-09 06:32:45] <Lurker69> and we didnt do anything in reverse, or does xoring count as palindrome, since it is reversible operation
[2013-01-09 06:33:23] <crash_demons> palindromes only refer to mirrored things
[2013-01-09 06:33:27] <Lurker69> what are the two primes wit extra space?

[2013-01-09 06:34:14] <absolutezeroff> 29 and 31?
[2013-01-09 06:34:17] <Lurker69> So space between 29  31 and 3257  3259
[2013-01-09 06:34:18] <Lurker69> And missing some primes between 71 1229
[2013-01-09 06:34:34] <absolutezeroff> hmm that's right
[2013-01-09 06:34:40] <crash_demons> there are no primes between 29 and 31.

[2013-01-09 10:46:09] <rb9269> have we all given up now?
[2013-01-09 10:46:13] <Absence_> no.
[2013-01-09 10:46:25] <Absence_> Just at a stand still, dont exactly know how to progress with the 2nd onion being down.
[2013-01-09 10:46:57] <chimp> im reading up on last years puzzle since im new to it all
[2013-01-09 10:47:05] <chimp> clutching at straws and so on
[2013-01-09 10:47:36] <rb9269> second onion? you mean the patience is a virtue one?
[2013-01-09 10:47:38] <Absence_> so where there a list of people whom 'official' won
[2013-01-09 10:47:39] <chimp> yeah
[2013-01-09 10:47:40] <Absence_> yeah
[2013-01-09 10:47:45] <chimp> its been down since.. what 2 days now?
[2013-01-09 10:47:50] <Absence_> going on 3rd.
[2013-01-09 10:47:54] <rb9269> yeah, its been a couple of days
[2013-01-09 10:47:55] <chimp> absence, im reading this:
[2013-01-09 10:48:05] <chimp> http://bernsteinbear.com/cicada
[2013-01-09 10:48:10] <rb9269> but whats the second onion to do with anything?
[2013-01-09 10:48:12] <chimp> the most detail talkthrough of last year
[2013-01-09 10:48:15] <rb9269> the first is still up
[2013-01-09 10:48:24] <Absence_> the first one gave us the 2nd
[2013-01-09 10:48:25] <chimp> no-one knows rb, maybe its a diversion
[2013-01-09 10:48:31] <Absence_> the 2nd one is where we got the furthest
[2013-01-09 10:48:31] <chimp> but the fact it just went down, instead of saying something else...
[2013-01-09 10:49:36] <rb9269> wasnt wisdom and folly the furthest we've gotten?
[2013-01-09 10:50:02] <rb9269> the problem with all this is that theres so many different threads of clues
[2013-01-09 10:50:13] <rb9269> which is probably what the "forest for the trees" jibe was about
[2013-01-09 10:50:39] <chimp> yeah rb
[2013-01-09 10:50:52] <chimp> i wish i didnt have to work
[2013-01-09 10:51:10] <chimp> so i had more free hours :p
[2013-01-09 10:51:39] <chimp> i mean that forest for the trees clue was in a hex dump, and then xor'd with the key from the mp3 right
[2013-01-09 10:51:52] <chimp> but the hello-onion 2 message didnt have to be xored
[2013-01-09 10:52:03] <rb9269> you having a laugh? i just got into work just now.
[2013-01-09 10:52:29] <rb9269> Britfag so its just turning 10:00 here, but im gonna be looking at this all day
[2013-01-09 10:52:39] <chimp> haha, britfag also
[2013-01-09 10:52:52] <chimp> im gonna be looking at it as well, but not devoting most of my cpu power
[2013-01-09 10:52:57] <chimp> i.e. my brain
[2013-01-09 10:52:58] <chimp> :/
[2013-01-09 10:53:04] <chimp> small as it may be
[2013-01-09 10:53:59] <rb9269> yeah, im the other way round
[2013-01-09 10:54:21] <rb9269> devoting most of my cpu to this
[2013-01-09 10:54:26] <rb9269> right...
[2013-01-09 10:54:42] <rb9269> so the mp3 gave us the "parable" hexdump
[2013-01-09 10:55:05] <rb9269> with the numbers all adding up using onion2 to the big number on the top
[2013-01-09 10:55:16] <chimp> hang on
[2013-01-09 10:55:19] <rb9269> the one and a half billion one
[2013-01-09 10:55:30] <rb9269> sorry, onion1 not onion 2
[2013-01-09 10:55:40] <rb9269> chimp, yeah
[2013-01-09 10:55:40] <rb9269> ?

[2013-01-09 10:57:27] <chimp> right so yes
[2013-01-09 10:57:33] <chimp> each line of that poem counted in the shell
[2013-01-09 10:57:45] <chimp> and the prime from each line multiplied
[2013-01-09 10:57:49] <chimp> produces the number at the start
[2013-01-09 11:00:05] <rb9269> yeah, so im not sure if that message has anymore to give
[2013-01-09 11:00:23] <rb9269> the iso has the wisdom folly messages
[2013-01-09 11:01:18] <chimp> wait i got that wrong
[2013-01-09 11:02:20] <spyne> yeah I'm kinda focusing on the wisdom and folly files
[2013-01-09 11:02:31] <spyne> it bothers me that they are exactly identical
[2013-01-09 11:03:05] <rb9269> its a messahe in itself
[2013-01-09 11:03:21] <rb9269> it means folly and wisdom are one and the same
[2013-01-09 11:03:23] <rb9269> i think
[2013-01-09 11:06:10] <chimp> brb
[2013-01-09 11:15:34] <spyne> what are the current theories about the last tweet? (Offset: 0, Skip: 0, Col: 65, Line: 988)

[2013-01-09 11:49:15] <Tech1> Spyne, i thought the assumption about the last tweet was meant for the extracted jpg? But we dint need it because ym dedudced properly

[2013-01-09 11:50:10] <NikTitanik> no progress since 12 hours ago?
[2013-01-09 11:50:15] <Tech1_Phone> Also, morning nik. Or afternoon.
[2013-01-09 11:50:25] <Tech1_Phone> Were you here for the SE?
[2013-01-09 11:50:36] <NikTitanik> se?
[2013-01-09 11:50:44] <Tech1_Phone> social engineering?
[2013-01-09 11:50:56] <NikTitanik> i left when you were talking about calling, what to say, etc
[2013-01-09 11:50:57] <spyne> Tech1: oh I might have missed this
[2013-01-09 11:51:16] <Tech1_Phone> ok ,well recap since i think it got pulled from the wiki
[2013-01-09 11:51:19] <spyne> I wasn't
[2013-01-09 11:51:19] <NikTitanik> so what did you engineer?
[2013-01-09 11:51:25] <Tech1_Phone> 1 sec
[2013-01-09 11:52:01] <Tech1_Phone> ok, so, one of the guys called linode, the company that was hosting the 2nd onion VPS
[2013-01-09 11:52:21] <NikTitanik> ok
[2013-01-09 11:52:43] <chimp> he get anywhere?
[2013-01-09 11:52:46] <Tech1_Phone> we were disputing about wether the account was canceled (IE the game ended) or the server was just powered off
[2013-01-09 11:52:57] <Tech1_Phone> *weather
[2013-01-09 11:53:04] <chimp> whether* but go on
[2013-01-09 11:53:09] <Tech1_Phone> Fucking english
[2013-01-09 11:53:11] <chimp> :D
[2013-01-09 11:53:12] <Tech1_Phone> haha
[2013-01-09 11:53:42] <Tech1_Phone> so, we werent able to get much, but we did find out that the account still existed
[2013-01-09 11:54:19] <Tech1_Phone> so, the machine is just powered off for reasons unknown
[2013-01-09 11:54:42] <chimp> maybe its still just paid up for the month
[2013-01-09 11:54:45] <Tech1_Phone> or, the 3rd possibility is that the account is canceled, but the info is kept till the start of the next billing cycle
[2013-01-09 11:54:51] <chimp> i.e. they wont pay for a second, at which point linode will auto format it all
[2013-01-09 11:54:54] <Tech1_Phone> exactly
[2013-01-09 11:54:56] <chimp> hm
[2013-01-09 11:55:25] <NikTitanik> ok
[2013-01-09 11:55:39] <Tech1_Phone> we also scanned ports 80 and 81 on every ip in the 1st onions subnet, hoping to stumble on the 2nd onion vps on the clearnet
[2013-01-09 11:56:10] <Tech1_Phone> logically ,they were probably created at the same time, so they may have very similar ips
[2013-01-09 11:56:33] <Tech1_Phone> No luck of course.
[2013-01-09 11:56:44] <chimp> maybe there is no second onion
[2013-01-09 11:56:45] <NikTitanik> so, a dead end
[2013-01-09 11:56:52] <Grazza> thats cool
[2013-01-09 11:57:00] <chimp> maybe the next real step is somewhere else entirely
[2013-01-09 11:57:11] <Tech1_Phone> correction, hoping to stumble upon the 1st onions clearnet address
[2013-01-09 11:57:39] <NikTitanik> does anyone have the link to the graph showing all steps in the last years search?
[2013-01-09 11:58:00] <Tech1_Phone> The 2nd onion's linode.com subdomain was obtained, we were hoping to find the 1st.
[2013-01-09 11:58:33] <Tech1_Phone> There was also disputes about if the leak to the clearnet ip was intentional or not.
[2013-01-09 11:58:39] <chimp> Parable 1,595,277,641  <---- what do you guys think this means
[2013-01-09 11:58:58] <Grazza> the number is the product of the count of the lines
[2013-01-09 11:59:00] <chimp> off topic slightly
[2013-01-09 11:59:09] <chimp> i know, using the onion 1 shell
[2013-01-09 11:59:11] <chimp> but why
[2013-01-09 11:59:17] <chimp> it was a much earlier step right
[2013-01-09 11:59:26] <chimp> and the poem was never used to solve anything else
[2013-01-09 11:59:34] <Grazza> yeah, the poem confuses me
[2013-01-09 11:59:38] <Grazza> i feel like there is somethin gthere
[2013-01-09 11:59:44] <chimp> why include it at all
[2013-01-09 11:59:51] <Grazza> to fuck with us
[2013-01-09 11:59:52] <Grazza> lol
[2013-01-09 11:59:59] <Tech1_Phone> I'm not sure how everything was used last year, but were there cluse that just didnt go anywhere?
[2013-01-09 12:00:09] <chimp> well we know they assigned the primes to letters
[2013-01-09 12:00:11] <Tech1_Phone> *clues
[2013-01-09 12:00:22] <chimp> and each line of that poem added up on that basis results in a prime
[2013-01-09 12:00:27] <chimp> so it had to be intentional, not fluke
[2013-01-09 12:00:40] <NikTitanik> nothing is fluke with cicada
[2013-01-09 12:00:47] <chimp> why to to that effort, why include the parable 1595 number
[2013-01-09 12:00:53] <Grazza> ^
[2013-01-09 12:00:54] <chimp> which is a specific number, at the top of the poem
[2013-01-09 12:01:25] <chimp> at some point they must have known wed use the count program
[2013-01-09 12:01:32] <chimp> and start counting things, including the poem
[2013-01-09 12:01:50] <Tech1_Phone> that shell got brute-ed hard. I dont think there is much left to be honest.
[2013-01-09 12:02:02] <chimp> nothing left command wise
[2013-01-09 12:02:03] <Grazza> yup
[2013-01-09 12:02:15] <chimp> there are lots of little things though
[2013-01-09 12:02:17] <chimp> unexplained
[2013-01-09 12:02:45] <chimp> like the primes list being incomplete
[2013-01-09 12:02:47] <spyne> well even if it was bruteforced, how was the output analysed?

[2013-01-09 12:04:42] <Grazza> no
[2013-01-09 12:04:45] <spyne> and this clue (from the command get hint) https://pastee.org/tjdbs
[2013-01-09 12:04:49] <spyne> how was it used?
[2013-01-09 12:05:00] <chimp> well it was a hexdump that had to be xor'd correct?
[2013-01-09 12:05:06] <chimp> whereas the original onion2 hexdump didnt
[2013-01-09 12:05:07] <Grazza> i feel like now we've tried to get any info out of the console or the mp3/iso
[2013-01-09 12:05:17] <Grazza> and we've failed
[2013-01-09 12:05:29] <Grazza> so there must be something we are missing in the poem or something else earlier
[2013-01-09 12:05:34] <Grazza> that should give us a clue
[2013-01-09 12:05:40] <chimp> well why encrypt the clue
[2013-01-09 12:05:43] <chimp> but not the onion 2 link
[2013-01-09 12:06:35] <Ymgve> also that line in the encrypted clue
[2013-01-09 12:06:47] <chimp> which line ymgve?
[2013-01-09 12:07:13] <Ymgve> "You can't see the forest when you're looking at the trees."
[2013-01-09 12:07:19] <chimp> oh, yeah

[2013-01-09 12:07:58] <Ymgve> also, in those messages there are some oddness with spaces in a few lines
[2013-01-09 12:08:13] <Ymgve> for the onion 2 message it goes 5 3 2 2 3 5
[2013-01-09 12:08:20] <Ymgve> for the trees message it goes 2 3 5 3 2

[2013-01-09 12:08:35] <Grazza> i didnt notice that
[2013-01-09 12:08:43] <chimp> so what if the clue itself isnt a clue, and the hello onion 1 isnt an answer
[2013-01-09 12:08:49] <chimp> and we are getting lost looking at them as such
[2013-01-09 12:09:25] <Ymgve> well if we are supposed to xor the hello message with something
[2013-01-09 12:09:28] <chimp> so what could the palindromic spacing mean
[2013-01-09 12:09:32] <Ymgve> it has to be with something that has a clear spacing

[2013-01-09 12:12:49] <perplexed> could the 560.13 be used to decrypt wisdom?
[2013-01-09 12:12:56] <Ymgve> it could
[2013-01-09 12:13:02] <Ymgve> but haven't managed to yet
[2013-01-09 12:13:24] <chimp> plus thats a bit samey
[2013-01-09 12:13:47] <Ymgve> only thing so far is that _560.00 seems to have an abnormal amount of printable ascii in its first 24 bytes
[2013-01-09 12:14:15] <Ymgve> it was also used to get the trees message, but that doesn't mean it can't be used for multiple purposes
[2013-01-09 12:14:49] <chimp> true
[2013-01-09 12:15:13] <perplexed> whered the trees one come from?
[2013-01-09 12:15:19] <perplexed> it just kind of 'became knowledge'

[2013-01-09 12:16:35] <Ymgve> xoring the result of that with 560.13 to get a base64 encoded png
[2013-01-09 12:16:55] <perplexed> yeah i

[2013-01-09 12:17:32] <Lurker69> almost
[2013-01-09 12:17:39] <perplexed> sorry
[2013-01-09 12:17:50] <Ymgve> due to patterns in the original data
[2013-01-09 12:18:05] <Ymgve> I originally xored the twitter data with a jpeg since there were some similarities
[2013-01-09 12:18:15] <Ymgve> and hey, isn't that the poem from the mp3?
[2013-01-09 12:18:19] <Grazza> mmhmm
[2013-01-09 12:18:20] <Lurker69> chimp:532235 is dom sam patern but it is taken from brteween teo piramids, 12321 si taken from the middkle on one pyramid
[2013-01-09 12:18:24] <Ymgve> doing it the other way -> partial rune pic
[2013-01-09 12:18:47] <chimp> so are they literally tri forcing
[2013-01-09 12:18:52] <Ymgve> Lurker69: the pyramids are irrelevant
[2013-01-09 12:18:57] <Ymgve> no
[2013-01-09 12:19:08] <chimp> you mean syllable count or something?
[2013-01-09 12:19:11] <Ymgve> it's just primes in different orders
[2013-01-09 12:19:13] <Lurker69> chimp:532235 is from same pattern but it is taken from between two pyramids, 12321 is taken from the middle on one pyramid
[2013-01-09 12:19:17] <chimp> yeah lruker
[2013-01-09 12:19:43] <chimp> what did you mean its like the poem ymgve
[2013-01-09 12:19:50] <Lurker69> Ymgve: i am just saying that 1235321 is same as 53211235 jsu different offset
[2013-01-09 12:20:18] <Ymgve> chimp: if you xor the twitter data with the thing that started this, 1357366592898.jpg, you get the start of the mp3
[2013-01-09 12:20:35] <Ymgve> since the header of the rune and 1357.... jpegs are the same
[2013-01-09 12:20:54] <perplexed> what happens if you xor the jpg with wisdom with folly
[2013-01-09 12:21:00] <Ymgve> garbage
[2013-01-09 12:21:23] <Lurker69> chimp: XOR is reversible function  (it thik i said it right)
[2013-01-09 12:21:26] <perplexed> what about with just 2 of them
[2013-01-09 12:21:49] <Ymgve> it basically goes like this: data with patterns + seemingly garbage data = seemingly garbage data
[2013-01-09 12:22:19] <Lurker69> mp3 XOR jpg = twitter   twititer XOR jpg = mp3
[2013-01-09 12:22:21] <Ymgve> of course, the "problem" is that this means seemingly garbage data + seemingly garbage data = data with patterns
[2013-01-09 12:22:41] <Ymgve> so we either have to xor two randomly looking things
[2013-01-09 12:22:51] <Ymgve> or we have to xor something with obvious patterns
[2013-01-09 12:23:14] <Lurker69> we couls teoreticaly XOR fout or even more garbage files and get one meaningful file out of them
[2013-01-09 12:23:38] <Ymgve> yeah
[2013-01-09 12:24:00] <Ymgve> for example, twitter xor mp3 xor 560.13 gives the base64 encoded png
[2013-01-09 12:24:17] <perplexed> does order matter?
[2013-01-09 12:24:20] <Ymgve> no
[2013-01-09 12:24:48] <Lurker69> but if one file was already used, to produce meaningfull message that puts some restrictions in hoe we could use that file again for xoring with other files....   i dont know how to explain that better ...

[2013-01-09 12:27:07] <Ymgve> anything that's not random
[2013-01-09 12:27:36] <Ymgve> use a hex editor to check the start of 560.13 for example
[2013-01-09 12:27:55] <perplexed> whats good to use on a mac?

[2013-01-09 12:32:01] <Ymgve> the cicadas should give us another hint
[2013-01-09 12:32:29] <Ymgve> but it bothers me that the phrase "patience is virtue" has the same number as the mp3
[2013-01-09 12:33:02] <perplexed> xor the patience is a virtue with mp3 with wisdom?
[2013-01-09 12:33:14] <Ymgve> gives nothing as far as I can see
[2013-01-09 12:33:17] <Ymgve> at least not at offset 0
[2013-01-09 12:33:38] <perplexed> or patience is a virtue with mp3 with 560

[2013-01-09 13:48:17] <chimp> 1031*
[2013-01-09 13:48:17] <chimp> count find the diivinity within and emerge
[2013-01-09 13:48:18] <chimp> 1229*
[2013-01-09 13:48:34] <chimp> and then those three numbers multiplied =  1 595 277 641 , yeah good idea lurker
[2013-01-09 13:48:36] <spyne> guys has anyone tried converting the missing primes from the "primes" command into text?
[2013-01-09 13:49:18] <chimp> dont think so spyne
[2013-01-09 13:49:33] <Ymgve> chimp: you have an extra i in divinity
[2013-01-09 13:49:53] <chimp> count find the divinity within and emerge
[2013-01-09 13:49:54] <chimp> 1229*
[2013-01-09 13:50:02] <chimp> fairly sure the count is right, i just type like a tard
[2013-01-09 13:50:16] <Ymgve> yeah, it is correct with the correct text
[2013-01-09 13:50:42] <Ymgve> just so someone don't think the misspelling was there already
[2013-01-09 13:50:51] <chimp> would be hilarious if the misspelling workedf

[2013-01-09 14:03:41] <rb9269> as in make up some words and work out the count from that?

[2013-01-09 14:10:25] <rb9269> i thought that was added after by one of us

[2013-01-09 14:12:55] <Lurker69> album art , when it was present was just from girst google image fond by searching song title, i think vlsc does that
[2013-01-09 14:13:35] <Lurker69> i still need to add part about instruments used in mp2, cosmo:_ was analyzing that , he even recodnized wich drumm was used

[2013-01-09 14:14:13] <nullsem> hi guys
[2013-01-09 14:14:20] <nullsem> I have been looking at the folly hex dump
[2013-01-09 14:14:38] <nullsem> and I found 2 coincidences that might be worth looking into
[2013-01-09 14:15:06] <nullsem> at line 00004c0: there is the hex pair 3301
[2013-01-09 14:15:20] |<-- Rascar has left freenode (Quit: WeeChat 0.3.8)
[2013-01-09 14:15:38] <nullsem> and also, five characters after offset 0000ce0
[2013-01-09 14:15:54] <nullsem> there is 0000ce5 which translates to 3301
[2013-01-09 14:16:06] <Lurker69> null??? grat find
[2013-01-09 14:16:32] <Ymgve> nullsem: err
[2013-01-09 14:16:35] <Lurker69> [14:15]	nullsem	and also, five characters after offset 0000ce0
[2013-01-09 14:16:36] <Lurker69> [14:15]	nullsem	there is 0000ce5 which translates to 3301
[2013-01-09 14:16:55] <Lurker69> find file that has 0000000000 at same sectors and xor ---> win
[2013-01-09 14:16:59] <Ymgve> any file larger than 4k will have an offset 0000ce5
[2013-01-09 14:17:13] <nullsem> sure yeah
[2013-01-09 14:17:18] <Ymgve> I can't see any _data_ at ce5 that has anything to do with anything
[2013-01-09 14:18:04] <nullsem> I really don't know if the file command checks for magic numbers only in the start of the file or in any place inside it
[2013-01-09 14:18:07] <Ymgve> also, hex 3301 has a 1 in 4 chance or something to appear in a random 4k file
[2013-01-09 14:18:14] <Lurker69> anyway song that reminds me on cicada instar song: https://soundcloud.com/aleks7     fun fact it was one of the completein of some other ARG, like award for comleting it, and it is so nice that it was worh all the time
[2013-01-09 14:18:19] <Lurker69> UMBRA was the arg
[2013-01-09 14:18:46] <Ymgve> nullsem: is there _anything_ at ce5 besides the fact that the file has more than ce5 bytes?
[2013-01-09 14:18:53] <Lurker69> http://siftumbra.wikia.com/wiki/UMBRA_Wiki
[2013-01-09 14:19:29] <nullsem> no... I just saw it and thought perhaps we can try to see if the bytes between those two points mean anything
[2013-01-09 14:19:42] <Ymgve> spoiler: they don't
[2013-01-09 14:19:56] <Ymgve> like I said, hex 3301 is a coincidence
[2013-01-09 14:20:08] <Lurker69> nullsem: appreciated, but apparently false alarm
[2013-01-09 14:20:13] <nullsem> fair enough
[2013-01-09 14:20:31] <Tech1_Phone> Yeah, i'd take that as gospel, coming from our local hex master.
[2013-01-09 14:20:45] <Ymgve> and you can't go looking for data in the offset column of a hex dump :)
[2013-01-09 14:21:59] <Ymgve> however if you find something like 00003301 or 00000ce5 in the _data_ I'm interested

[2013-01-09 14:28:53] <Lurker69>  /pasting links
[2013-01-09 14:29:29] <artea> do you think the cicada warning is actually a clue?
[2013-01-09 14:29:55] <artea> a lot of those quoted phrases when put through the gematria turn out reversible primes
[2013-01-09 14:30:10] <Lurker69> wich warning? that about foundig god and taying away from cicada?
[2013-01-09 14:30:18] <artea> yes
[2013-01-09 14:31:08] <Lurker69> yes it is a clue, i understand it ilike that:  if you are even remotely religious stay away from cicaada, we dont need fools that believe in imaginary guy living in the sky
[2013-01-09 14:32:00] <Lurker69> https://soundcloud.com/aleks7/part-of-my-heart  this sums it up

[2013-01-09 14:35:45] <Lurker69> but seriously
[2013-01-09 14:35:52] <Ymgve> cicada is actually just a branch of /r/atheism
[2013-01-09 14:35:52] <Lurker69> about that pastebinn
[2013-01-09 14:36:13] <Lurker69> it is clearly it was written in advance so it is not just a troll
[2013-01-09 14:36:32] <Lurker69> also person who wrote it knw that next day cicada puzzzle will begin
[2013-01-09 14:36:38] <Lurker69> not many peoplel knew that
[2013-01-09 14:37:09] <Lurker69> also he was literate, not many mistakes, nice language (that excludes me as possible author :-)
[2013-01-09 14:37:15] <artea> well ty for that music lurker XD
[2013-01-09 14:37:25] <Lurker69> so he was or is at some point member of cicada
[2013-01-09 14:38:20] <Ymgve> poor Lurker69
[2013-01-09 14:38:23] <Lurker69> and i think that people that are in cicada, that solve the puizzles, DONT FIND TRUE GOD AND HIS SON....    i thnik we are way past that leve whenre you can be fooled by bible
[2013-01-09 14:38:29] <Ymgve> was almost in cicada but failed their spelling test
[2013-01-09 14:39:56] <Lurker69> artea: i am listeninx to taht alex atm, his electronic songs are als very very good, i am into quite into techno
[2013-01-09 14:41:18] <Lurker69> artea: and as i said that song "part of my heart" reminds me on cicadas Instar song, that is why i remembered it, and i have no idea how UMBRA ARG PM found that guy, he has very little views, i suspect he knows him personnaly
[2013-01-09 14:45:10] <artea> ah, definitely sounded similiar

[2013-01-09 16:04:35] <lulzorz> and cicada is most likely in that category
[2013-01-09 16:04:47] <lulzorz> so we are actively trying to gain membership in a terrorist group
[2013-01-09 16:04:50] <chimp> oh right

[2013-01-09 16:09:16] <Lurker69> tor will be history soon, and not because it is bad but because it si to good to not be noticed by major players on world politics map
[2013-01-09 16:09:37] <Grazza> can someone explain how tor works?
[2013-01-09 16:09:41] <chimp> yeah you do hear about tor and the darknet more and more mainstream
[2013-01-09 16:09:44] <Grazza> cuz im not really sure
[2013-01-09 16:09:50] <chimp> and its never in a good light
[2013-01-09 16:10:06] <lulzorz> Lurker69: tor hidden services are a Good Thing, but we need a fuckton of random people running tor relays for them to be safe
[2013-01-09 16:10:47] <Lurker69> Grazza: basically it encrypts all the data and sends it to many different servers befor it reaches designated adress, it is almost impossible to find our who is the sender and reciever if you are not one of them
[2013-01-09 16:11:01] <Tech1_Phone> Lulz, your in the US?
[2013-01-09 16:11:26] <lulzorz> Lurker69: also, I'm not certain, but I think that Room 641A allows timing attacks to be done on the network which allow the US govt to break tor's anonymity (and they have RSA broken, which means they can read SSL traffic)
[2013-01-09 16:12:03] <lulzorz> Tech1_Phone: it's not really relevant where I am, and the US actually protects their own citizens more than the rest of the world
[2013-01-09 16:12:13] <Lurker69> lulzorz: yes tor is grreat but it is  so public tha governemnts are  taking it seriously and  developing new and new ways to block it, i am afraid that it will eanad with making it illegal in US and EU
[2013-01-09 16:12:55] <lulzorz> there have been recorded instances of US operatives detaining citizens of other countries in their homelands for extended periods
[2013-01-09 16:13:21] <lulzorz> Lurker69: the US can control tor, so they don't worry about it
[2013-01-09 16:13:36] <Grazza> ok
[2013-01-09 16:13:50] <lulzorz> Lurker69: i2p development is done anonymously, which means it's very easy for a group with the right resources to backdoor it
[2013-01-09 16:14:14] <lulzorz> (i2p is also a fat, slow piece of java shit, but that's irrelevant)
[2013-01-09 16:17:07] <lulzorz> in the end, there's at least one good way to attack anything
[2013-01-09 16:17:33] <lulzorz> ioerror is living proof that the govt doesn't really like tor THAT much, so there is at least hope in my mind
[2013-01-09 16:18:48] <Lurker69> US govt are to good at hacking...    but reason why they will ban it is , i am afraid, because of pressures form licence owners corporations  to prevent piracy of their so valuable movies and mp3s, at least it is happeninh it that direction in EU, based on antipiracy laws ISPS are recording all the IP conections of their client, torrenting sony movies is already ticketed in germany and...
[2013-01-09 16:18:48] <Lurker69> ...france, people are getting letters from sony lawyers demanding money or face criminal offence

[2013-01-09 17:33:28] <Lurker69> i we will be stuck for longer we should consider more recruiting
[2013-01-09 17:34:16] <Lurker69> there is posibility that waiting time is hebe because cicada is waiting for large enough numbers of recruiters, to lunch next stage 
[2013-01-09 17:34:31] <iIIustrious> Did they do that last year?
[2013-01-09 17:34:37] <Lurker69> not sure
[2013-01-09 17:34:45] <Lurker69> last yar it was timer on tor
[2013-01-09 17:34:53] <Lurker69> so people know how long to wait
[2013-01-09 17:34:56] <iIIustrious> I'm never sure how much they care about numbers. They don't advertise well, haha

[2013-01-09 17:37:06] <Tech1> did we pass the time in UTC from last year that the onion popped?
[2013-01-09 17:37:10] <Lurker69> and lst yer there were "drops"  (posters with QR code in various plces
[2013-01-09 17:37:18] <iIIustrious> Well, we could make some more threads I suppose

[2013-01-09 17:37:35] <iIIustrious> Or, if we're really feeling like it, I *could* put something on reddit.

[2013-01-09 17:43:16] <iIIustrious> I'd not heard this story
[2013-01-09 17:43:52] <Lurker69> he told that to me few days ago
[2013-01-09 17:44:09] <iIIustrious> ah
[2013-01-09 17:44:45] <Lurker69> someone stopped using that nick on interent and backpak picked it up, he sdsaid that first person might be dead since there arent any ne posts of dihim anywhere
[2013-01-09 17:44:58] <iIIustrious> Huh
[2013-01-09 17:45:05] <iIIustrious> odd

[2013-01-09 17:52:02] <chimp> yeah but lurker,
[2013-01-09 17:52:06] <iIIustrious> You'd think it'd be a common one, but I guess not
[2013-01-09 17:52:07] <chimp> its not going to be as common as "dog"

[2013-01-09 17:54:20] <lull> might be a clue?

[2013-01-09 17:55:48] <Tech1> maltego? lol
[2013-01-09 17:57:00] <Lurker69> but Mandelbrot is clearly fake
[2013-01-09 17:57:10] <Lurker69> but if you study the IDs in thread
[2013-01-09 17:57:33] <Lurker69> you will notice that three or two people made the thread and keep it bumped and informed
[2013-01-09 17:57:52] <Lurker69> they have all the oppictures from last year prepared with nice filenames
[2013-01-09 17:58:11] <Lurker69> and they were keeping trols away and answering on provocations
[2013-01-09 17:58:26] <iIIustrious> Do you think it was them?
[2013-01-09 17:58:38] <Lurker69> you can clearly destinguis them by use of language and kindnes that isnt common on  /b/
[2013-01-09 17:58:42] <iIIustrious> It could just be people expecting it to start again soon, there was a lot of talk of it coming
[2013-01-09 17:59:02] <Lurker69> only people from cicad could know it will start next day
[2013-01-09 17:59:32] <Lurker69> and that long pastebin was cerefull written in advance... lots of time spent on it, clearly was some kind of plan
[2013-01-09 17:59:35] <iIIustrious> maybe, but wasn't it a year to the day later?
[2013-01-09 17:59:55] <iIIustrious> I agree on the pastebin, that seems too conspicuous
[2013-01-09 18:00:15] <Lurker69> and if OP was just random person... why he is not among us then?
[2013-01-09 18:00:30] <iIIustrious> That's a really good question
[2013-01-09 18:00:45] <Lurker69> nobody of us adnmitted to post in that thread!  that is , hm lets say conspicious
[2013-01-09 18:01:05] <chimp> how many people in this chan never say anything?
[2013-01-09 18:01:18] <chimp> i mean im pretty useless, but i have been talking quite a lot

[2013-01-09 18:01:38] <Lurker69> and in reality, all the people who made it in last year are surely interested in happening this year, thy all must be watching and luling
[2013-01-09 18:01:41] <iIIustrious> I feel like most people have talked at least a few times
[2013-01-09 18:01:52] <Lurker69> BNC i am sure of it
[2013-01-09 18:02:09] <chimp> right going home, catch you all in a bit

[2013-01-09 18:02:16] |<-- chimp has left freenode ()
[2013-01-09 18:02:23] <Lurker69> it must be about 30 people from last year
[2013-01-09 18:02:52] <iIIustrious> I thought last year was bigger than that
[2013-01-09 18:02:56] <Lurker69> at least 20 of them must be interested to follow this and compare to last years things...
[2013-01-09 18:03:06] <Lurker69> i know i would be lurking on it
[2013-01-09 18:03:08] <iIIustrious> or do you mean that finished it
[2013-01-09 18:03:16] <Lurker69> yes finished
[2013-01-09 18:03:29] <Lurker69> i think not more than 50 people finished 
[2013-01-09 18:03:41] <Lurker69> more like 20 or 30 i would say
[2013-01-09 18:03:49] <iIIustrious> Either way, I know a few of them that I expected to be watching, and haven't seen them yet
[2013-01-09 18:03:59] <Lurker69> :-)
[2013-01-09 18:04:07] <Lurker69> last yeaers cicadas channel is empty
[2013-01-09 18:04:38] <iIIustrious> no suprise there
[2013-01-09 18:04:39] <Lurker69> and few of last years winners were still logging in from time to time, they all stop signing in in december
[2013-01-09 18:04:48] <iIIustrious> haha

[2013-01-09 18:04:52] <iIIustrious> that's interesting
[2013-01-09 18:05:32] <iIIustrious> I wish freenode would get groups working again
[2013-01-09 18:06:54] <Lurker69>   so yeah i think we will need to recruit  few more developers and programmers in near future...  we are way to small to provide all the lulz that happened last year
[2013-01-09 18:07:41] <iIIustrious> Lol, wasn't last year full of trolling?
[2013-01-09 18:07:50] <Lurker69> yes
[2013-01-09 18:08:11] <Lurker69> this year will be less, i hope
[2013-01-09 18:08:40] <Lurker69> you could try leaving comment on blogs of people that are in, if you want to provoke them
[2013-01-09 18:08:57] <iIIustrious> speaking of trolling, OTP's looked fairly troll free so far, or did I just miss it
[2013-01-09 18:09:00] <Lurker69> i am actually surprised people didnt spam that bearguys blog
[2013-01-09 18:09:20] <Lurker69> http://bernsteinbear.com/cicada
[2013-01-09 18:09:21] <iIIustrious> Fair, but we are still a pretty small group
[2013-01-09 18:09:46] <Lurker69> he had way longer post about cicada when he originally published it
[2013-01-09 18:10:03] <Lurker69> and then he removed it and publishe this short version  later

[2013-01-09 18:51:03] <Tech1> the thought is that the account may still be active till end of billing cycle even though it was canceled

[2013-01-09 18:55:04] <chimp-> would it be that game breaking cooper?
[2013-01-09 18:55:21] <Cooper5> By finding that kind of hole, and them taking the site down because of it, maybe we can't continue.
[2013-01-09 18:55:56] <rr645> Worst case scenario they'd find a way to patch it up and put us back on track. They've put too much effort into making a once-a-year event to just drop it all because of one technical screwup, I suspect.
[2013-01-09 18:56:08] <Cooper5> True.
[2013-01-09 18:56:12] <chimp-> there is the primes as well, the list
[2013-01-09 18:56:15] <chimp-> and the missing primes
[2013-01-09 18:56:19] <chimp-> we dont know what they mean or if they are relevant
[2013-01-09 18:56:32] <Tech1> i'm with you rr645. but the dispute is still if it was intentional
[2013-01-09 18:56:47] =-= lull is now known as lull|afksomekfc
[2013-01-09 18:56:49] <Cosmo_> Why is the word prime used to describe primes? Doesn't it mean first?
[2013-01-09 18:56:56] <chimp-> the only thing ive noticed is that the first major chunk of missing primes starts where primes go from 2 decimals long to 3
[2013-01-09 18:57:09] <rr645> First or most basic. Primes are the most basic numbers--they make up all other numbers

[2013-01-09 19:18:19] <Lurker69> offsest by different prime numbers that were mennitoned
[2013-01-09 19:18:28] <Lurker69> you can xopr three files

[2013-01-09 19:19:17] <Lurker69> many many combinations
[2013-01-09 19:19:47] <Ixateht> reverse xor makes a palindrome output for the file
[2013-01-09 19:19:52] <Ixateht> but that happens for all files

[2013-01-09 19:28:24] <Lurker69> ymgve do you think trying xoring reversed files, and trying to xor with offsets for known prime numbers could yield some results?

[2013-01-09 19:31:29] <soulseekah> but again, I searched throughout didn't find those bytes, (including reverse byte order)
[2013-01-09 19:31:48] <Lurker69> soulseekah: good to know...
[2013-01-09 19:31:55] <AlooGobi> Soul, tell me you got some sleep last night.
[2013-01-09 19:32:05] <soulseekah> so it's probably enocded twice
[2013-01-09 19:32:05] <Lurker69> when we will be desperate eenough wewil try that again
[2013-01-09 19:32:14] <soulseekah> and that's harder to calculate
[2013-01-09 19:32:34] <soulseekah> but it's a good strategy, albeit it didn't yield result
[2013-01-09 19:32:43] <soulseekah> AlooGobi, yep, getting some overdue work done now
[2013-01-09 19:32:47] <soulseekah> while nothign's happening
[2013-01-09 19:32:54] <AlooGobi> I'm glad :)
[2013-01-09 19:33:49] <Lurker69> soulseekah: dont forget that fooly and wisdom being new random files they might be wored with  png or  Gamatia jpg, or origginal cicada jpg, or tweets or hint or hello
[2013-01-09 19:34:09] <soulseekah> Lurker69, I looked in the png and Gemantria and the tweets
[2013-01-09 19:34:14] <soulseekah> and with hello
[2013-01-09 19:34:16] <Lurker69> ok
[2013-01-09 19:34:17] <soulseekah> but not with hint
[2013-01-09 19:34:26] <Lurker69> dont fogrt on telnet dumps
[2013-01-09 19:34:42] <Lurker69> and mp3 and DATA files  :-)
[2013-01-09 19:34:52] <Lurker69> more than i think moore possibilites 
[2013-01-09 19:34:59] <absolutezeroff> twitter profile pic
[2013-01-09 19:35:04] <soulseekah> yep, I looked into DATA, and mp3 too, and profile twitter pic
[2013-01-09 19:35:10] <Lurker69> even CD ISO Might be used
[2013-01-09 19:35:10] <soulseekah> anythign I could land my hands on
[2013-01-09 19:35:22] <soulseekah> didn't try iso though
[2013-01-09 19:35:32] <soulseekah> so I missed ISO and "hint" dump
[2013-01-09 19:36:04] <soulseekah> I'll try some more later tonight if I have time
[2013-01-09 19:36:18] <Lurker69> tweeeter profile pis is prbably not since it seems to me that tweeter resave the image on lower resolution when you upload it, but worth trying i might be wron and it can still be used
[2013-01-09 19:36:43] <soulseekah> Lurker69, yeh
[2013-01-09 19:37:15] <Lurker69> but they can upload it on tweerte, download again and then generate wisdom and fooly
[2013-01-09 19:37:24] <Lurker69> tweeter was made in dec right?
[2013-01-09 19:37:24] <soulseekah> true
[2013-01-09 19:37:30] <Lurker69> enough time for thata
[2013-01-09 19:37:35] <soulseekah> yes 30 minutes before new year
[2013-01-09 19:37:39] <soulseekah> UTC time
[2013-01-09 19:37:42] <Lurker69> lol
[2013-01-09 19:37:50] <Lurker69> so PM is not in EU
[2013-01-09 19:37:56] <soulseekah> so they're probably US
[2013-01-09 19:38:09] <soulseekah> I doubt they'd do it in the night after
[2013-01-09 19:38:14] <soulseekah> only during the day on the 31st
[2013-01-09 19:38:28] <Lurker69> US sound reasonable yeah
[2013-01-09 19:38:32] <rr645> The vast majority of the GPS coords last year were US based--we assumed the were US-based then as well
[2013-01-09 19:39:16] <soulseekah> btw, did anyone actually look at the ASN fields in the signature? time, name, etc.?
[2013-01-09 19:39:39] <soulseekah> time can be relevant, and can be supplied when signing
[2013-01-09 19:39:42] <Lurker69> ASN fields in the signature ?
[2013-01-09 19:39:53] <Lurker69> not sure...
[2013-01-09 19:39:57] <soulseekah> yes the DER encoded ones
[2013-01-09 19:40:01] <Lurker69> i made screenshots 
[2013-01-09 19:40:23] <soulseekah> somebody parse the signature and get the timestamps please
[2013-01-09 19:40:25] <AlooGobi> The names of the files on the iso were prime. Was there a 560.?
[2013-01-09 19:40:43] <Lurker69> http://i.imgur.com/1Y4KR.png no date
[2013-01-09 19:41:08] <Lurker69> i dont know how to get date out of signature
[2013-01-09 19:41:14] <soulseekah> since the timestamps canbe supplied manually they could be significant
[2013-01-09 19:41:17] <soulseekah> there it is though
[2013-01-09 19:41:22] <soulseekah> Signed on 2013-01-06...
[2013-01-09 19:41:29] <Lurker69> yes stupid I
[2013-01-09 19:41:36] <soulseekah> but would be nice to get actual unix timestamp

[2013-01-09 19:42:41] <AlooGobi> 560 isn't prime. Why would they use that number along with 761

[2013-01-09 19:44:43] <AlooGobi> Do these dates mean that they're making these things on the spot?
[2013-01-09 19:44:44] <soulseekah> they can be supplied manually, but peculiar

[2013-01-09 19:45:52] <iIIustrious> or hint generates the message, timestamp included?

[2013-01-09 19:46:09] <iIIustrious> is hint called more recently providing the same timestamp?

[2013-01-09 19:51:39] <Lurker69> žThere's nothing to stop a dishonest user from altering the date and time setting of his own system's clock, and generating his own public key certificates and signatures that appear to have been created at a different time. He can make it appear that he signed something earlier or later than he actually did, or that his public/secret key pair was created earlier or later. This may have some...
[2013-01-09 19:51:39] <Lurker69> ...legal or financial benefit to him, for example by creating some kind of loophole that might allow him to repudiate a signature. 
[2013-01-09 19:53:23] <Lurker69> In situations where it is critical that a signature be trusted to have the actual correct date, people can simply use notaries to witness and date a handwritten signature. The analog to this in digital signatures is to get a trusted third party to sign a signature certificate, applying a trusted timestamp. No exotic or overly formal protocols are needed for this. Witnessed signatures have...
[2013-01-09 19:53:23] <Lurker69> ...long been recognized as a legitimate way of determining when a document was signed.

[2013-01-09 20:22:57] <n_factor> one byte at a time
[2013-01-09 20:23:03] <n_factor> with 3 files output.
[2013-01-09 20:23:24] <n_factor> one with the bits of the byte in reverse order
[2013-01-09 20:23:42] <n_factor> one with the 4 bit words reversed ( i.e. 0D = D0 )
[2013-01-09 20:23:58] <n_factor> and one with the byte left as is.
[2013-01-09 20:24:11] <n_factor> i wrote it in perl, but its too slow
[2013-01-09 20:24:17] <soulseekah> why
[2013-01-09 20:24:43] <n_factor> so i can reverse the data files we are working with for analysis purposes
[2013-01-09 20:24:44] <soulseekah> maybe the input file is huge
[2013-01-09 20:24:54] <n_factor> the input file is huge.
[2013-01-09 20:25:04] <lulzorz> say, 130MB?
[2013-01-09 20:25:19] <soulseekah> and how slow is slow for that?
[2013-01-09 20:25:22] <n_factor> not the whole iso
[2013-01-09 20:25:35] <Ymgve> what how can you get that slow
[2013-01-09 20:25:40] <n_factor> i'm outputting about 4k/sec
[2013-01-09 20:25:48] <soulseekah> ...show your code
[2013-01-09 20:25:49] <Ymgve> are you reading one and one byte?
[2013-01-09 20:25:54] <lulzorz> how about arg is number of bits in each reversal chunk (1, 8, 16)
[2013-01-09 20:25:58] <lulzorz> reads from stdin
[2013-01-09 20:26:02] <lulzorz> writes to stdout
[2013-01-09 20:26:12] <n_factor> i'm reading the entire thing into memory then processing it from end to beginning
[2013-01-09 20:26:29] <Ymgve> that shouldn't be that slow
[2013-01-09 20:26:40] <soulseekah> show the code, n_factor
[2013-01-09 20:27:03] <Cosmo__> I can't find anything on this spectograph yet.
[2013-01-09 20:27:11] <n_factor> i even tried doing array lookup with preprocessed reversals
[2013-01-09 20:27:14] <n_factor> to speed things up
[2013-01-09 20:27:16] <n_factor> it didnt help much
[2013-01-09 20:27:22] <n_factor> i think its my interpretter
[2013-01-09 20:27:27] <n_factor> maybe i'll grab a compiler
[2013-01-09 20:27:33] <n_factor> brb

[2013-01-09 21:02:26] <soulseekah> xor all the things
[2013-01-09 21:02:28] <Ymgve> not enough
[2013-01-09 21:02:49] <Ymgve> the big question is if there is anything more to be discovered at the moment
[2013-01-09 21:03:13] <Ymgve> or if we have to wait for the next phase
[2013-01-09 21:03:36] <soulseekah> all the xoring, prime multiplication, rune counts is too much hay

[2013-01-09 21:03:49] <Ymgve> did they provide hints last year?
[2013-01-09 21:03:56] <lulzorz> "that means come back soon"
[2013-01-09 21:04:02] <lulzorz> pretty obvious amirite?

[2013-01-09 21:04:11] <soulseekah> come back soon - may also mean: go back to an earlier stage

[2013-01-09 21:04:31] <lulzorz> it was funny watching people trying to find 800 different meanings for "patience is a virtue" in here
[2013-01-09 21:04:46] <soulseekah> the strange thing is that onion1 still outputs onion2 address
[2013-01-09 21:04:49] <lulzorz> and then seeing them find the comment
[2013-01-09 21:04:59] <Ymgve> well it is odd that it corresponds to the number in the song filename
[2013-01-09 21:05:00] <soulseekah> so anyone joining the quest now finds that it's broken

[2013-01-09 21:26:29] <soulseekah> Tech1, yes, I'm making a list of significant primes that we know of
[2013-01-09 21:26:40] <soulseekah> and feeding it to go daddy mass registration
[2013-01-09 21:26:45] <soulseekah> to see which ones are occupied
[2013-01-09 21:26:48] <Tech1> good call
[2013-01-09 21:26:54] <Tech1> ...and which are hosted on linode.
[2013-01-09 21:26:55] <Tech1> haha
[2013-01-09 21:27:25] <soulseekah> ah, but see now, that they're not necessarily hosted
[2013-01-09 21:27:38] <soulseekah> maybe the key will be in a call to whois or dig
[2013-01-09 21:27:50] <Tech1> yeah
[2013-01-09 21:28:07] <Tech1> i'm still pretty surprised that we didn't get any returns from the scans yesterday
[2013-01-09 21:28:10] <Tech1> i was hopeful
[2013-01-09 21:28:27] <soulseekah> yesterday was all about bruteforcing all the things, was qutie fun
[2013-01-09 21:28:37] <Kokosnuss> Well, if you take the number, "1,595,277,641" and remove the commas and google search it, it is part of an ISBN of a math dvd. Cicada is about freeing up information, right? So, later on when it says to shed our circumferences, I'd imaging they're saying to get rid of the physical form of the DVD, and just provide the information for it online.
[2013-01-09 21:29:06] <Tech1> hmm
[2013-01-09 21:29:30] <Kokosnuss> Also, obvious connections being math DVD > Circumfrence because of it being a math term about circles, and it being a circle (the DVD)
[2013-01-09 21:30:07] <NikTitanik> interesting
[2013-01-09 21:30:48] <Kokosnuss> Then, when it talks about "Like the instar, tunneling to the surface We must shed our own circumferences; Find the divinity within and emerge", it probably means evolving as a socioty to get past the need for loyalties, and greed in general, and working souly for the better of socioty
[2013-01-09 21:31:14] <Kokosnuss> That's my take on it, anyway
[2013-01-09 21:31:24] <Tech1> count discovering math data and graphs: 1327+
[2013-01-09 21:32:03] <Kokosnuss> And maybe the fact that the count of the poem adds up to 1,595,277,641 is saying that we should focus more on that number, to come to that conclusion, anyway
[2013-01-09 21:32:53] <iIIustrious> I mentioned already, but I'd be curious to see if the word divine/divinity is present in the "book"
[2013-01-09 21:32:58] <Tech1> 1327 is in the first 1k primes
[2013-01-09 21:33:11] <chimp-> i did try searching crowleys work for "parables"
[2013-01-09 21:33:16] <soulseekah> 1595277641 isn't about circles, where did you find the circles book?
[2013-01-09 21:33:25] <soulseekah> I can only see a statistics book with that ISBN
[2013-01-09 21:33:35] <Tech1> 1327 is a domain

[2013-01-09 21:35:31] <lulzorz> count  Like the instar, tunneling to the surfaceWe must shed our own circumferences;Find the divinity within and emerge.
[2013-01-09 21:35:35] <lulzorz> 3519
[2013-01-09 21:35:46] <Kokosnuss> It's not about circles, but it is about math, which we're doing a lot of. And the fact that it's a DVD, and mentions circumferences (the shedding of them) and that cicada is about freeing information (I forget where I read that, I'll look for that next)
[2013-01-09 21:35:47] <fasd> it refers to circumferences and there are 2 definite circles on a dvd
[2013-01-09 21:35:53] <lulzorz> parable does not add to 1,595,277,641
[2013-01-09 21:35:54] <chimp-> ok rb ill have a look
[2013-01-09 21:36:24] <chimp-> lulzors
[2013-01-09 21:36:29] <chimp-> count each line, then multiply the 3
[2013-01-09 21:36:31] <Kokosnuss> lulzors "If you count (add) each word from the poem  (using onion console tellnet or Gamatria Primus table) you get 1595 277641"
[2013-01-09 21:37:43] <fasd> it is interesting that it is the only number that they have separated with commas
[2013-01-09 21:38:29] <chimp-> i tried checking out bible parables , using the 3 lines as  3 parables formatted xx:xx
[2013-01-09 21:38:39] <Ymgve> Kokosnuss: that's the worst explanation ever
[2013-01-09 21:38:43] <chimp-> but...not even sure what to look for
[2013-01-09 21:38:46] <Ymgve> because it's wrong
[2013-01-09 21:38:51] <lulzorz> a phrase would have to be about 50m letters to count at 1595277641
[2013-01-09 21:38:53] <Kokosnuss> fasd I'd assume it's because that's how it was in the hex dump
[2013-01-09 21:39:09] <Ymgve> for each _line_ you add all letters, then you multiply the result from each line
[2013-01-09 21:39:14] <Kokosnuss> Ymgve why's that?
[2013-01-09 21:39:30] <lulzorz> oh, there we go
[2013-01-09 21:39:31] <Kokosnuss> That was the explination in the wiki
[2013-01-09 21:39:42] <Ymgve> then whoever wrote the wiki did a bad job
[2013-01-09 21:40:44] <chimp-> does the shell factorise numbers according to the highest possible numbers?
[2013-01-09 21:41:02] |<-- patient has left freenode (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[2013-01-09 21:41:04] <chimp-> i.e. use the highest possible number that can divide into the input number
[2013-01-09 21:41:18] <Kokosnuss> Are you talking about adding the poem together to get 1595277641?
[2013-01-09 21:41:29] <lulzorz> there are no two ways to factor a number...
[2013-01-09 21:41:35] <chimp-> no, one of the other functions of the shell was factorising non prime numbers
[2013-01-09 21:41:48] <chimp-> curiously, often in reverse i think
[2013-01-09 21:42:01] <chimp-> i.e. it would give you the factors for the reverse of the input number
[2013-01-09 21:42:09] <lulzorz> it tries them backwards if they don't work forwards

[2013-01-09 21:42:27] <chimp-> but it does them forwards if it can?
[2013-01-09 21:42:52] <iIIustrious> oh, that explains a lot
[2013-01-09 21:43:13] <Kokosnuss> So, does anyone mind if I add my interpretation?
[2013-01-09 21:45:00] <rb9268> if the console reverses the numbers before it primes them, why not do the same to the parable: 146 277 595 1
[2013-01-09 21:45:41] <chimp-> lulzors said it will factorise non prime numbers, if it cant then it will factorise them as reverse
[2013-01-09 21:46:04] |<-- anomalous has left freenode (Quit: Page closed)
[2013-01-09 21:46:16] <soulseekah> it reverses only the ones that are prime
[2013-01-09 21:46:25] <soulseekah> which just made me think...
[2013-01-09 21:46:45] <chimp-> uh, are you sure soulseekah
[2013-01-09 21:46:51] <chimp-> if you enter primes doesnt it just say +
[2013-01-09 21:46:58] <iIIustrious> I've seen it do that too
[2013-01-09 21:47:01] <chimp-> or is that for reversible primes only
[2013-01-09 21:47:10] <soulseekah> palprimes only
[2013-01-09 21:47:10] <iIIustrious> there's been some numbers I didn't get how they were factoring...
[2013-01-09 21:47:27] <chimp-> shit i cant remember, uh
[2013-01-09 21:47:34] <iIIustrious> so, the + is just for numbers that are prime in both directions, like 3301
[2013-01-09 21:47:39] <chimp-> well that makes sense, if it cant factorise a non emirp
[2013-01-09 21:47:40] <soulseekah> yes
[2013-01-09 21:47:47] <chimp-> it tries it backwards instead
[2013-01-09 21:47:49] <chimp-> since then it wont be a prime
[2013-01-09 21:47:50] <soulseekah> but if in reverse it's not a prime it will factor it
[2013-01-09 21:47:56] <chimp-> yeah
[2013-01-09 21:48:00] <soulseekah> yes, + is only ouptut for palprimes
[2013-01-09 21:48:12] <Kokosnuss> Maybe that's what the linux version was hinting at, stopping at 3301 and 1033?
[2013-01-09 21:49:00] <Tech1> wait did the shell ignore spaces?
[2013-01-09 21:49:49] <rb9268> so we know the meaning of the +'s
[2013-01-09 21:50:23] <rb9268> what are they for tho?

[2013-01-09 22:02:40] <Ymgve> fasd: well
[2013-01-09 22:02:45] <Ymgve> fasd: we used it
[2013-01-09 22:02:56] <Ymgve> but you can't say it was "in" that file
[2013-01-09 22:03:10] <chimp-> xor'd with it right ?
[2013-01-09 22:03:14] <Ymgve> yeah
[2013-01-09 22:03:26] <Ymgve> but it's like adding 1 + X = Y
[2013-01-09 22:03:41] <Ymgve> can you say Y is stored "in" 1?
[2013-01-09 22:03:45] <rb9268_> so we used the wisdom/folly file?
[2013-01-09 22:03:49] <Ymgve> the data from onion1 is X
[2013-01-09 22:03:50] <Ymgve> no
[2013-01-09 22:03:51] <fasd> could it be that its referring to the file as a tree and the combination of all 3 as the forest?
[2013-01-09 22:03:55] <Ymgve> wisdom/folly is unused
[2013-01-09 22:04:16] <chimp-> who knows fasd, there are a dozen ways to look at it
[2013-01-09 22:04:17] <rb9268_> okay, and we were xor'in it with what?
[2013-01-09 22:04:21] <chimp-> if anything the clue just makes things more confusing
[2013-01-09 22:04:51] <chimp-> and since the clue was encrypted whereas the onion 2 link wasnt
[2013-01-09 22:04:54] <rb9268_> no, the clue just means we need to keep using more than one item to carry on the quest
[2013-01-09 22:04:56] <chimp-> is the clue itself the tree,
[2013-01-09 22:05:01] <chimp-> distracting from the forest
[2013-01-09 22:05:04] <Ymgve> rb9268_: we're xoring _560.00 with the data you get in the onion1 terminal when you type 'hint'
[2013-01-09 22:05:27] <rb9268_> _560 being wisdom/folly?
[2013-01-09 22:05:36] <Ymgve> no
[2013-01-09 22:05:40] <Ymgve> _560.00 is _560.00
[2013-01-09 22:05:43] <Ymgve> it's the name of the file

[2013-01-09 22:05:59] <rb9268_> oh yeah,
[2013-01-09 22:07:11] <Ymgve> so far we have "used" about 1000 bytes from the start of _560.00, about 65kbyte from the start of the mp3 and about 65kbyte from 560.13

[2013-01-09 22:22:57] <rb9268_> is that twitters random naming or was that properly named?

[2013-01-09 23:03:58] <soulseekah> weird...
[2013-01-09 23:04:00] <Lurker69> but since i am winfag...  i guess i wont be able to recognize it
[2013-01-09 23:04:18] <soulseekah> I xord this start image... with... one of the data files ... and get a starting base64 string with PNG in it
[2013-01-09 23:04:31] <Lurker69> i szspect cicada is ucing linux to make those images
[2013-01-09 23:04:36] <soulseekah> but the base64 is incomplete,...

[2013-01-09 23:06:46] <Ymgve> you're not supposed to use the start image
[2013-01-09 23:06:49] <Ymgve> but the rune image
[2013-01-09 23:07:09] <soulseekah> I thought we didn't know what were supposed to do

[2013-01-09 23:07:27] <Ymgve> well that has been known for a few days
[2013-01-09 23:07:34] <soulseekah> since start image was brought up I thought I'd give it a xor too

[2013-01-09 23:12:00] <Tech1> isn't there a compression artifact analysis tool?

[2013-01-09 23:12:39] <Lurker69> but i suspect that on higher commpression rate outguess anomalies are harder to spot
[2013-01-09 23:13:21] <Lurker69> there are no traces of any txt strings that software usually leave in jpgs, no exif at all
[2013-01-09 23:14:01] <Lurker69> and all  4 jpgs looks to be made on samecomputer, same setings
[2013-01-09 23:17:04] <Ymgve> the 521x523 png has a timestamp
[2013-01-09 23:18:06] <Ymgve> but, 2012-12-31 23:37:39 doesn't say much

[2013-01-09 23:28:59] <Lurker69> because he did damn good fake image
[2013-01-09 23:29:05] <Tech1> hex, 6 sides...

[2013-01-09 23:59:23] <n_factor> did you count it/
[2013-01-09 23:59:25] <Ymgve> if that's not just a red herring
[2013-01-09 23:59:29] <n_factor> count Patience is a virtue.
[2013-01-09 23:59:40] <Ymgve> same as the mp3
[2013-01-09 23:59:48] <Ymgve> but the mp3 has been torn apart back and forth
/* 10 January 2013 */
[2013-01-10 00:01:07] <maxxtro9> What about the 560.17 file? Im kinda lost since my internet was down
[2013-01-10 00:02:02] <Ymgve> seems completely random as far as we can tell
[2013-01-10 00:02:34] <Lurker69> actuall we dont have message "Patience is a virtue" anymore
[2013-01-10 00:02:49] <Lurker69> we had it but we lost it
[2013-01-10 00:03:00] <Lurker69> all we have is record of it in wiki
[2013-01-10 00:03:02] <Lurker69> so..

[2013-01-10 00:04:06] <soulseekah> no, i mean hint to go to onoin2
[2013-01-10 00:04:12] <Lurker69> i we wouldnt put it in wiki or if we would be in secret channel nobody would know about that message
[2013-01-10 00:04:14] <soulseekah> is still there on onion1

[2013-01-10 00:04:45] <soulseekah> who was keeping track of time?
[2013-01-10 00:04:54] <Lurker69> nobody
[2013-01-10 00:04:56] <Tech1> i think it passed soul
[2013-01-10 00:04:59] <Lurker69> you can go to the log
[2013-01-10 00:05:01] <Lurker69> d
[2013-01-10 00:05:04] <soulseekah> about the site having to come up like last year
[2013-01-10 00:05:15] <Lurker69> ah that time
[2013-01-10 00:05:20] <Tech1> soulseekah: someone mentioned it today when i was at work...like 8 hours ago
[2013-01-10 00:05:26] <Tech1> and they said it was at 5 then
[2013-01-10 00:05:28] <soulseekah> yes, that
[2013-01-10 00:05:39] <soulseekah> so how much left? or passed already?
[2013-01-10 00:05:42] <Lurker69> i waas thinking you are trying to figure out what our action triggered  tor 2 t obe taken down
[2013-01-10 00:05:43] <Tech1> passed
[2013-01-10 00:05:56] <Tech1> it easily could have
[2013-01-10 00:06:08] <Tech1> we discussed the leak here once it was found
[2013-01-10 00:06:28] <Tech1> anyone been watching /x/?
[2013-01-10 00:06:32] <soulseekah> perhaps it was meant to be accessed only N number of times
[2013-01-10 00:06:41] <soulseekah> then go offline once it got N many requests
[2013-01-10 00:06:47] <Lurker69> btw:  how do you understand You can't see the forest when you're looking at the trees.  ?
[2013-01-10 00:07:01] <Lurker69> like this is wrong way only decoys here
[2013-01-10 00:07:02] <Tech1> hmm, it'd still require something manual to power odwn the linode sou
[2013-01-10 00:07:03] <Tech1> l
[2013-01-10 00:07:14] <soulseekah> Tech1, no not really
[2013-01-10 00:07:15] <Tech1> well, possibly
[2013-01-10 00:07:24] <Tech1> yeah, just realized that one.
[2013-01-10 00:07:32] <Tech1> cron can power down cant it?
[2013-01-10 00:07:42] <soulseekah> init 0 and down we go
[2013-01-10 00:08:05] <soulseekah> but again, why would it need/want to be automated
[2013-01-10 00:08:41] <soulseekah> maybe it was never important
[2013-01-10 00:08:45] <soulseekah> and onion2 is in fact the tree
[2013-01-10 00:09:20] <soulseekah> <Ymgve> if that's not just a red herring
[2013-01-10 00:09:23] <Tech1> false trail from onion1 to onion2
[2013-01-10 00:09:33] <Tech1> so, either way, 2 is out.
[2013-01-10 00:09:58] <Tech1> either out becuause it's wrong, or out because it's down
[2013-01-10 00:10:02] <Ymgve> damn I thought I had something
[2013-01-10 00:10:08] <soulseekah> yet we have the mp3 which should defnitely have something
[2013-01-10 00:10:18] <Ymgve> but it appears that the border of a random picture always looks like it has patterns
[2013-01-10 00:10:19] <soulseekah> Ymgve, elaborate?
[2013-01-10 00:10:24] <soulseekah> oh
[2013-01-10 00:10:48] <Ymgve> thought I saw a pattern in one of the dats when looking at it as an image
[2013-01-10 00:11:03] <soulseekah> meaning why bother do an mp3 that is only used as a source of bytes for the xor, the audio itself has to be hiding something
[2013-01-10 00:11:04] <Ymgve> but then tried the same with a newly random-generated block of bytes
[2013-01-10 00:11:20] <soulseekah> interesting
[2013-01-10 00:11:33] <Ymgve> nah, not really
[2013-01-10 00:11:45] <Ymgve> it's just that the contrast with a black background makes you see things

[2013-01-10 01:07:00] <lulzorz> oh, guys, if we get a bunch of coords like last year
[2013-01-10 01:07:07] <lulzorz> we need to make a new channel for handling the masses
[2013-01-10 01:07:32] <lulzorz> or it's going to go to utter shit in here
[2013-01-10 01:07:33] <Absence_> We need to be quick and responsive, before others are.
[2013-01-10 01:07:36] <lulzorz> like it did last year
[2013-01-10 01:07:42] <maxxtro9> patience is a virtue--> patience is one of the seven virtues--> tuesday has 7 letters (also, it's a prime) maybe something will happen next tuesday?

[2013-01-10 01:08:18] <bakpak2hvy> but werent there a shit ton of groups last year?
[2013-01-10 01:08:22] <Lurker69> we got last dron in oregon yesterday in few hours we  got a guy who will go to location..
[2013-01-10 01:08:42] <bakpak2hvy> virginia reporting in

[2013-01-10 01:09:40] <Lurker69> 2 public channels botd yround 50 people i think
[2013-01-10 01:09:48] <bakpak2hvy> so whats going on this year?
[2013-01-10 01:09:53] <bakpak2hvy> why are we the only ones?
[2013-01-10 01:09:55] <Lurker69> and  all the secret groups i wasntin
[2013-01-10 01:10:08] <bakpak2hvy> maybe its too early in the game
[2013-01-10 01:10:14] <bakpak2hvy> but really though

[2013-01-10 01:10:55] <bakpak2hvy> made it through last year
[2013-01-10 01:11:00] <bakpak2hvy> and are building this one
[2013-01-10 01:11:03] <Absence_> no
[2013-01-10 01:11:15] <Absence_> all the ones last year broke off into a 2nd group
[2013-01-10 01:11:18] <Absence_> and tricked the rest
[2013-01-10 01:11:21] <Lurker69> and how many people came to ARG is very luck dependend... no rules there some stupid args have 1000s od players some genious ones hve 20 people... hard to predict
[2013-01-10 01:11:43] <primius> Absence_: not all of them
[2013-01-10 01:11:44] <Absence_> Last year this had a LOT more people.

[2013-01-10 01:12:00] <primius> I was in that group...there were trolls and people winning outside it
[2013-01-10 01:12:02] <bakpak2hvy> i dont think #smartpeople is around any more
[2013-01-10 01:12:07] <bakpak2hvy> havent heard anything about it in a while
[2013-01-10 01:12:09] <Absence_> I guess a lot of people thik this is a hoax this way through

[2013-01-10 01:12:36] <bakpak2hvy> this is legit though

[2013-01-10 01:16:01] <Lurker69> yes
[2013-01-10 01:16:15] <soulseekah> no first we need to actually get the coordinates

[2013-01-10 01:16:20] <soulseekah> ^
[2013-01-10 01:16:22] <Tech1> i think it's safe to say we've probably got 90% of locations in the US within a few hours
[2013-01-10 01:16:28] <Lurker69> soulseekah:  nailed it
[2013-01-10 01:16:35] <Absence_> Well last time they told us patience is a virtue people were sent out across the world.

[2013-01-10 01:17:30] <Absence_> I'd love to see who dropped it.
[2013-01-10 01:17:40] <Absence_> Probably did it at night but, just another clue.
[2013-01-10 01:17:53] <lulzorz> Absence_: private groups got a few that most people don't know about

[2013-01-10 01:39:43] <n_factor> Patience is a virtue.
[2013-01-10 01:39:56] <Ymgve> Lurker69: someone probably just uploaded mine
[2013-01-10 01:40:05] <Lurker69> yes i thnk so
[2013-01-10 01:40:15] <Ymgve> unless it happened before monday midday UTC
[2013-01-10 01:40:16] <Lurker69> you posted some partial results
[2013-01-10 01:40:36] <Lurker69> no wa to know since no links were given
[2013-01-10 01:41:25] <Ymgve> but whatever
[2013-01-10 01:41:35] <Ymgve> at worst it might have gotten more people interested
[2013-01-10 01:41:50] <Lurker69> anyway we  have 2 rules      1.  no PGP -->obvious troll is obvious      2.   if you make a claim and no link is given no fucks will be given on claim
[2013-01-10 01:42:18] <iIIustrious> that pdf is just the teaching guide again
[2013-01-10 01:42:24] <iIIustrious> still not the book
[2013-01-10 01:42:24] <Lurker69> also it would be nice to have all the 4chan threads archieved
[2013-01-10 01:42:25] <Ymgve> 3. PGP that uses whitespace encoding but has no trust relationship is trolling too
[2013-01-10 01:42:56] <Lurker69> also if bored try to outguess all the jpgs from first post
[2013-01-10 01:43:26] <Lurker69> http://chanarchive.org/4chan/b/65987/it-s-been-a-year-now-have-there-been-any-more-threads-like-this-since
[2013-01-10 01:43:59] <Lurker69> ^this was made by cicadapeople  acting to be trolls, maybe some random jpg in it has some outguess
[2013-01-10 01:44:18] <Ymgve> possibly
[2013-01-10 01:44:21] <Lurker69> check IDS and you can easily see who is 4channer and who is from cicada
[2013-01-10 01:45:13] <Lurker69> there were 3 or  4 IDs that acts like normal persons and apare posting lastyears pictures , explaining icada game and keeping trail on topic

[2013-01-10 02:02:28] <maxxtro9> also*
[2013-01-10 02:03:10] <Ymgve> but not for that long
[2013-01-10 02:03:12] <one> i think there's more right now that others have already found but are not sharing the info on it
[2013-01-10 02:03:17] <Ymgve> and they had a specific time to wait for
[2013-01-10 02:03:54] <AlooGobi> We've lost the drive. We haven't been rewarded in a while. off the trail
[2013-01-10 02:04:02] <zebra> Maybe cicada wants people to work by themselves.

[2013-01-10 03:26:19] <Cooper5> I made sure I was using the raw text output from it but Still got nothing readable.
[2013-01-10 03:26:38] <Cooper5> Should I try removing the colons?
[2013-01-10 03:26:46] <Cooper5> (that sounds messy)
[2013-01-10 03:26:54] <soulseekah> anything that anyone xors please document in http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/XOR_all_the_things

[2013-01-10 03:29:01] <n_factor> the spaces in the forest message...
[2013-01-10 03:29:03] <n_factor> 23532
[2013-01-10 03:29:26] <soulseekah> there are spaces in the hello message too
[2013-01-10 03:29:32] <n_factor> reminds me of the ones that appeared in the outguess of the goodbye.jpg last year
[2013-01-10 03:29:33] <soulseekah> 53235 I think
[2013-01-10 03:29:36] <AlooGobi> whoa
[2013-01-10 03:29:53] <n_factor> it was like 2357532
[2013-01-10 03:30:00] <Ixateht-home> one was 2-3-5-3-2
[2013-01-10 03:30:06] <Ixateht-home> one was 5-3-2-2-3-5
[2013-01-10 03:30:13] <Grazza> i think the other was 5 3 2 2 3 5
[2013-01-10 03:30:16] <Grazza> ye
[2013-01-10 03:30:22] <soulseekah> something like that
[2013-01-10 03:30:41] <AlooGobi> On the Raw clue, why isn't the offset 3301?
[2013-01-10 03:30:42] <n_factor> what were get 3301 and 1033 do?
[2013-01-10 03:31:19] <soulseekah> get 3301 == hint if I remember correctly
[2013-01-10 03:31:31] <soulseekah> AlooGobi, what is the raw clue?
[2013-01-10 03:31:57] <maxxtro9> hey hey hey on the console, i put 23532 and i got 2 2 3 37 53
[2013-01-10 03:31:58] <soulseekah> oh, that you mean, well it is believed that the offset is the offset of the file that is xord with
[2013-01-10 03:32:09] <soulseekah> maxxtro9, those are factors
[2013-01-10 03:32:11] <Grazza> maxxtro9: thats the factorization
[2013-01-10 03:32:14] <soulseekah> yeh
[2013-01-10 03:32:26] <maxxtro9> aaw thats boring...
[2013-01-10 03:32:29] <soulseekah> AlooGobi, so offset 0 meant no offset when xoring with one of hte data files
[2013-01-10 03:32:46] <AlooGobi> Soul, the result of asking for a clue in the console.
[2013-01-10 03:32:48] <soulseekah> and 3301 for first message matched an offset into the iso
[2013-01-10 03:33:00] <soulseekah> but that maybe just a concidence
[2013-01-10 03:33:08] <AlooGobi> hmmm alright
[2013-01-10 03:33:11] <soulseekah> or an indication that no xoring was necessary
[2013-01-10 03:33:23] <soulseekah> iso has 00 bytes at 3301 which fitted
[2013-01-10 03:33:49] <AlooGobi> I see I see
[2013-01-10 03:33:49] <rr645> get 3301 doesn't spit out the hint--it spits out other hex
[2013-01-10 03:34:12] <soulseekah> the hello one?
[2013-01-10 03:34:36] <soulseekah> k tyes, that's the hello one
[2013-01-10 03:34:42] <soulseekah> same as get messge, hi, hello
[2013-01-10 03:34:43] <rr645> yeah, that's right
[2013-01-10 03:34:46] <soulseekah> k
[2013-01-10 03:35:11] <soulseekah> my mistake on the wiki then
[2013-01-10 03:36:39] <Ixateht-home> anyone looked at the size of 560.13 and 560.17

[2013-01-10 03:36:52] <Ixateht-home> both are palindromic primes in size
[2013-01-10 03:36:59] <AlooGobi> Are the error messages from the console generic between other linux programs?
[2013-01-10 03:38:08] <soulseekah> AlooGobi, only 4 of the 6 were identified
[2013-01-10 03:38:20] <soulseekah> the %3301, .. \?\ is unknown
[2013-01-10 03:38:39] <soulseekah> and the "there are many others" error is not from any prompt, just a rhyme
[2013-01-10 03:38:50] <AlooGobi> Alright
[2013-01-10 03:39:28] <Ixateht-home> 118818811 2013-01-08 13:02 560.13

[2013-01-10 03:40:48] <AlooGobi> Can you do something with the cicada figure in the console? Xor?
[2013-01-10 03:41:08] <soulseekah> AlooGobi, the difficulty with that is that we don't know the width of the cicada ascii art
[2013-01-10 03:41:33] <soulseekah> but worth a try of course
[2013-01-10 03:42:02] <maxxtro9> i'll show this again http://www.englishclub.com/ref/esl/Idioms/C/can_t_see_the_forest_for_the_trees_149.htm
[2013-01-10 03:43:34] <AlooGobi> Width? How many characters across?
[2013-01-10 03:43:56] <soulseekah> yes
[2013-01-10 03:44:08] <AlooGobi> We can count that
[2013-01-10 03:44:09] <soulseekah> it could be padded with spaces to say 65 columns
[2013-01-10 03:44:20] <soulseekah> or maybe not padded and be rugged on the left
[2013-01-10 03:44:26] <soulseekah> the right I mean, sorry
[2013-01-10 03:44:41] <AlooGobi> hmmm... can we try based on what we see?
[2013-01-10 03:44:59] <soulseekah> we see different things based on the width of our terminals
[2013-01-10 03:45:17] <soulseekah> the data comes in without padding on the right of course
[2013-01-10 03:45:31] <soulseekah> only left padding is applied to keep it an artsy
[2013-01-10 03:45:32] <AlooGobi> I see,
[2013-01-10 03:45:42] <AlooGobi> I see so much
[2013-01-10 03:45:50] <soulseekah> the edges are terminated with \n
[2013-01-10 03:46:15] <AlooGobi> right

[2013-01-10 06:13:37] <Cosmo_> who likes who now? What did i miss?
[2013-01-10 06:13:46] <primius> Cosmo_: your name is special to the console
[2013-01-10 06:13:59] <Cosmo_> Bahaha!! Ok....wanna explain that? or...?
[2013-01-10 06:14:11] <primius> clearly, you are 3301
[2013-01-10 06:14:29] <Cosmo_> Oh I am am i.... Hell of a way to find this  out.... I don't know how I'll tell my friends
[2013-01-10 06:14:53] <primius> it's ok, we understand
[2013-01-10 06:15:15] <Cosmo_> ... Seriously someone gonna fill me in or do I just have to play along with this?
[2013-01-10 06:15:30] <primius> it's a lot easier to be 3301 these days than it used to be
[2013-01-10 06:15:43] <Cosmo_> Apparently so because I've done fucking nothing.
[2013-01-10 06:15:52] <primius> your name
[2013-01-10 06:16:09] <Cosmo_> does what to the console exactly?
[2013-01-10 06:16:10] <primius> the gematria says you're a paliprime
[2013-01-10 06:16:16] <Cosmo_> WOO!
[2013-01-10 06:16:31] <primius> meanwhile I'm fucking 243
[2013-01-10 06:16:49] <primius> 3^5...I guess it's a somewhat special number

[2013-01-10 06:17:30] <primius> can't argue with that
[2013-01-10 06:17:31] <Cosmo_> I wonder what my real name comes out has.... I'mma find out....
[2013-01-10 06:17:39] <Cosmo_> Are we adding or multiplying? I assume adding
[2013-01-10 06:17:58] <primius> IDK, I feed it shit and it gives me numbers
[2013-01-10 06:18:12] <soulseekah> it's adding the runes
[2013-01-10 06:18:16] <Cosmo_> I can't access the console right now, so fuck it, let's do this manually
[2013-01-10 06:18:17] <soulseekah> as per the table
[2013-01-10 06:18:28] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, why no console?
[2013-01-10 06:18:29] <primius> table and console don't always match
[2013-01-10 06:18:38] <soulseekah> primius, example?

[2013-01-10 06:19:11] <soulseekah> depends on how you count it

[2013-01-10 06:45:55] <Cosmo_> What else is there to do? I tried everything i know in terms of every graph for the mp3 (except amadeus which i have to wait for) and the parables and riddles don't have any reference point.
[2013-01-10 06:47:29] * crash_demons wonders why only the last two numbers for that are primes
[2013-01-10 06:47:54] <primius> I guess we wait
[2013-01-10 06:48:05] <primius> and maybe plan for various things coming up
[2013-01-10 06:56:13] <Cosmo_> In the console if you type a number, then 'tnuoc' it gives the result then '...'
[2013-01-10 06:56:19] <Cosmo_> anyone know why? I'm curious
[2013-01-10 06:56:25] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, yes, that happens with any word

[2013-01-10 08:28:54] <zebra> I also tried some outguessing again but nothing new.
[2013-01-10 08:29:22] <Cosmo_> I'm mostly doing it out of curiosity. I've tried looking into the golden ration in terms of prime numbers...there's a connection but that doesn't achieve anything
[2013-01-10 08:29:46] <Cosmo_> I've listen to the mp3 for the thousandth time, i've even tabbed it and tried THOSE numbers out of desparation
[2013-01-10 08:30:07] <zebra> Maybe the mp3 should be reversed?
[2013-01-10 08:30:39] <Cosmo_> I've reversed it, spectographed it, taken it apart in layers, played it against itself, seperated the tracks, checked for backmasking....
[2013-01-10 08:30:47] <Cosmo_> I was in a sound studio yesterday with it
[2013-01-10 08:31:09] <Cosmo_> There's a section on the wiki about the 'fucking nothing' I found =P
[2013-01-10 08:31:34] <zebra> Have you, I forgot what it's called, but it's in audacity you can remove music and listen for voice
[2013-01-10 08:31:55] <Cosmo_> Tried that, but audacity is not the one for that =P
[2013-01-10 08:31:58] <zebra> There's also one where you can remove voice, I haven't listened to the mp3 myself though
[2013-01-10 08:32:05] <zebra> What are you using for it?
[2013-01-10 08:32:06] <Cosmo_> I've got a metric fuck-ton of add-ons for logic pro in the studio
[2013-01-10 08:32:22] <Cosmo_> I'm a sound engineer with a university full of equipment
[2013-01-10 08:32:40] <zebra> I'll play around with the mp3 a bit tomorrow, but I doubt I will get anywhere.
[2013-01-10 08:32:46] <zebra> How old are you?
[2013-01-10 08:33:01] <Cosmo_> the problem is mp3's are a sound guy's worst nightmare. The quality is awful and the way they're coded means that only one sound plays at a time it's....eurgh
[2013-01-10 08:33:23] <Cosmo_> But mum told me not to tell strangers ont he internet anything.....I'm 19 bro
[2013-01-10 08:33:57] <zebra> lol, shit my too. You're 19 and you have a studio to test this?

[2013-01-10 08:34:27] <Cosmo_> I also live with an acoustics masters student

[2013-01-10 08:34:57] <zebra> Nice, but ya I have no knowledge of anything with mp3's
[2013-01-10 08:35:25] <zebra> I would ask my cousin to help, he graduated from computer science but I doubt he will try this.
[2013-01-10 08:35:37] <Cosmo_> mp3's are satan's testicles. I kid got thrown out of a class where we had to play our own music because he'd converted it to mp3
[2013-01-10 08:35:42] <zebra> WHo's idea was it to wait for tuesday?
[2013-01-10 08:35:55] <Cosmo_> .....I don't think I was here for that
[2013-01-10 08:36:30] <zebra> Someone said that patience is the 7th virtue, 7 is a prime number and tuesday has 7 letters in it. so we should wait for tuesday
[2013-01-10 08:36:58] <Cosmo_> By that logic we should wait till july, but it's better thinking than nothing I suppose
[2013-01-10 08:37:14] <zebra> Maybe it's true, remember last year they made us wait?
[2013-01-10 08:37:21] <zebra> Maybe they are just not giving us a count down this time.
[2013-01-10 08:37:37] <Cosmo_> Actually no, I wasn't here last year, it was my first year of university so I was passed out under a bench somewhere...
[2013-01-10 08:37:39] <zebra> But you'd expect a hint atleast.
[2013-01-10 08:38:02] <zebra> I wasn't here last year either, I just read about it although I wish I was here last year.
[2013-01-10 08:38:10] <Cosmo_> I'm half expecting the twitter to start back up.... I just hope it doesn't do it now because no one seems to be here and i'd have no idea what to do other than copy and paste it
[2013-01-10 08:38:22] <Cosmo_> Screw last year, I'm happy to be here this year
[2013-01-10 08:38:34] <zebra> I was checking twitter a lot yesterday but nothing happened I think twitter is dead.
[2013-01-10 08:38:38] <Cosmo_> I don't intend to be the guy that solves it, I'm just hoping i can do a small part to help the guy who does
[2013-01-10 08:38:57] <Cosmo_> If it's dead why didn't they just de-activate it? I think it's worth keeping an eye on
[2013-01-10 08:39:01] <zebra> lol I cant even solve it, I just like to try. It's fun.
[2013-01-10 08:39:31] <zebra> THat's true but it could also be a distraction
[2013-01-10 08:39:45] <Cosmo_> I don't know if I want to work for people who segregate the intelligent from the bright with skill-specific tests =P
[2013-01-10 08:40:14] <zebra> Did you read the message posted on pastebin?
[2013-01-10 08:40:18] <Cosmo_> Everything COULD be a distraction, I honestly think too much time is going into these consoles. Guess work won't do it, we need something specific to go in there
[2013-01-10 08:40:22] <zebra> About how the group is dangerous?
[2013-01-10 08:40:31] <Cosmo_> I've read them all.
[2013-01-10 08:40:36] <zebra> Do you think its real?
[2013-01-10 08:40:39] <zebra> or just a troll?
[2013-01-10 08:41:07] <Cosmo_> I honestly have no idea. If it's a troll, it's well written with a vivid imagination, but it's also not doing a good job convincing me they're evil
[2013-01-10 08:41:08] <zebra> I don't think we have anything solid, in my opinion I think we should wait
[2013-01-10 08:41:36] <Cosmo_> Ah if only I were the sort of non-insomniac that could.

[2013-01-10 08:42:30] <zebra> THey are probably watching irc anyways.
[2013-01-10 08:42:37] <Cosmo_> Anyway, if the number 7 was so important, why is no one spending more time trying to work out the cicada image on the console
[2013-01-10 08:42:44] <Cosmo_> it's literally made of 7's
[2013-01-10 08:43:02] <Cosmo_> If they are, I only have one question =P
[2013-01-10 08:43:05] <zebra> are you talking about the idea with 7 and tuesday?
[2013-01-10 08:43:09] <Cosmo_> Yeah man
[2013-01-10 08:43:31] <zebra> it seems pretty realistic
[2013-01-10 08:43:41] <zebra> if patience is the 7th virtue,
[2013-01-10 08:44:06] <zebra> then the fact that tuesday is 7 letters long and and 7 is prime
[2013-01-10 08:44:11] <zebra> sound like more than a coincidence
[2013-01-10 08:44:12] <Cosmo_> yeah but they could've made that cicada image out of something else, and everything else has been intentional....why 7's?
[2013-01-10 08:44:22] <Cosmo_> No it sounds EXACTLY like a coincidence =P
[2013-01-10 08:44:32] <Cosmo_> But that's all we have
[2013-01-10 08:45:21] <Cosmo_> Also, I get that they chose a cicada because of the prime numbe life pattern..... But the cicada has no natural predators because of it...why are they so secretive?
[2013-01-10 08:45:56] <zebra> thats true. but then again last year when they said patience is a virtue they had a countdown
[2013-01-10 08:45:59] <Cosmo_> If they represent reincarnation, why are they doing this year after year?
[2013-01-10 08:46:04] <zebra> wait, what day did the onion 2 go down?
[2013-01-10 08:46:12] <zebra> maybe they need new people?
[2013-01-10 08:46:19] <Cosmo_> I won't lie all the days have run into one, check the wiki
[2013-01-10 08:46:32] <Cosmo_> Were the old ones not good enough?
[2013-01-10 08:47:05] <zebra> it doesnt say waht day it went down
[2013-01-10 08:47:08] <zebra> what*
[2013-01-10 08:47:24] <Cosmo_> Doesn't it? It was a couple of days ago, not long after it was accessed as far as i remember
[2013-01-10 08:47:37] <Cosmo_> Keep in mind you and i probably live in different timezones
[2013-01-10 08:47:44] <Cosmo_> it's 07:45 in the morning here
[2013-01-10 08:47:53] <zebra> Ya thats true
[2013-01-10 08:47:58] <zebra> its 3 am for me
[2013-01-10 08:48:20] <zebra> I kinda hope they put locations again
[2013-01-10 08:48:26] <zebra> I hope one is near me.
[2013-01-10 08:49:16] <Cosmo_> I really hope if they put one near me i'm not the only one nearby....I'm so lazy you have no idea
[2013-01-10 08:49:31] <zebra>  I'm not so much lazy as scared
[2013-01-10 08:49:36] <zebra> you never know what could be there
[2013-01-10 08:49:48] <zebra> I just find it sketchy that someone will post coordinates online
[2013-01-10 08:50:00] <Cosmo_> I don't fear the unknown, i just regard it with mild amusement untill it tries to kill me
[2013-01-10 08:50:18] <zebra> What if it tries to kill you when you go to the locations? O.o
[2013-01-10 08:50:27] <Cosmo_> Then someone will have the location I died?
[2013-01-10 08:50:37] <zebra> Ya but u'd be dead
[2013-01-10 08:51:04] <Cosmo_> Yes I suppose I would. But I'd have died for a helluva game, and none of you lot would attempt it again. I'd die so you guys don't
[2013-01-10 08:51:06] <Cosmo_> consider it the greater good
[2013-01-10 08:51:10] <Cosmo_> I don't want or plan to though
[2013-01-10 08:51:27] <Cosmo_> because I think it's far easier to set up a load of letter drops, rather than a load of death traps
[2013-01-10 08:51:38] <Cosmo_> Ever the realist me.
[2013-01-10 08:51:44] <zebra> thats true and if cicada were murdere's they'd probably kill last year
[2013-01-10 08:51:56] <Cosmo_> Exactly. unless....that's why they need new people ;)
[2013-01-10 08:51:57] <Cosmo_> Hahaha!
[2013-01-10 08:52:01] <zebra> lol
[2013-01-10 08:52:13] <zebra> however if they post locations and noone in the irc is near them then we are kind of fucked
[2013-01-10 08:52:16] |<-- n_factor has left freenode (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[2013-01-10 08:52:25] <zebra> we would have to find people to go there
[2013-01-10 08:52:59] <Cosmo_> Exactly. Either way if they wanted an egotistical insomniac with an obsession with sound and a mildly high IQ....they could choose anyone from my sound engineering class.
[2013-01-10 08:53:16] <zebra> Ya but it wouldn't be as fun as it is now
[2013-01-10 08:53:19] <zebra> or mysterious...
[2013-01-10 08:53:20] <Cosmo_> If it helps I have people in france, canada, central america and all over the UK that owe me favours
[2013-01-10 08:53:36] <zebra> lol! but if one comes up in my location i would go
[2013-01-10 08:54:00] <Cosmo_> I would too. Far be it from me to withold information from you guys.
[2013-01-10 08:54:21] <zebra> I wouldnt even be able to proceed if I withheld info
[2013-01-10 08:54:25] <zebra> I'm not that good at this
[2013-01-10 08:55:03] <Cosmo_> That too. I've spent today researching what these guys have done already just so i have any idea what they're all talking about. I really hope there's more sound stuff later so i can actually be helpful
[2013-01-10 08:55:19] <Cosmo_> Or anything to do with history or psychology......or...drama
[2013-01-10 08:55:31] <zebra> Has anyone played around with the first jpg?
[2013-01-10 08:55:44] <Cosmo_> Which one do you consider the first one?
[2013-01-10 08:55:50] <zebra> just a thought im going to throw it, Last year you had to multiply the first jpg's dimensions with 3301 and add a .com
[2013-01-10 08:55:52] <Cosmo_> Because i'm pretty sure the answer for any of them
[2013-01-10 08:55:55] <Cosmo_> is.....yes
[2013-01-10 08:55:58] <zebra> has anyone tried that this year?
[2013-01-10 08:56:09] <Cosmo_> More than likely, but do it anyway
[2013-01-10 08:56:10] <zebra> the first one where it says they are back
[2013-01-10 08:56:13] <zebra> HOld on
[2013-01-10 08:57:05] <zebra> Bring me to an open dns page
[2013-01-10 08:57:06] <zebra> nothing here
[2013-01-10 08:57:37] <Cosmo_> [shrugs] was worth a go
[2013-01-10 08:57:54] <zebra> I think at this point anything is
[2013-01-10 08:58:00] <zebra> considering everyone is stuck
[2013-01-10 08:58:17] <Cosmo_> Don't say stuck, say 'differently able'
[2013-01-10 08:58:29] <zebra> anyways i'm getting tired so im going to go to sleep for the night but I will be on tomorrow.
[2013-01-10 08:58:35] <zebra> We are able but we need time
[2013-01-10 08:58:41] <Cosmo_> I'll be on....pretty much able

[2013-01-10 09:28:32] <Lurker69> i just woke up
[2013-01-10 09:28:37] <Lurker69> our numbers are falling
[2013-01-10 09:29:03] <soulseekah> last few days have been slow
[2013-01-10 09:29:39] <Lurker69> i ddint mange to prove 100% that XORED png was used for tweeter profile, i cant product same profile picture yet
[2013-01-10 09:29:58] <Lurker69> i need to be able to move my mouse for exactly one pixel  O.o
[2013-01-10 09:30:20] <Grazza> dang
[2013-01-10 09:30:26] <Grazza> how many times do you have to do that?
[2013-01-10 09:30:27] <Lurker69> does anybody have some sort od mouse keyboard simulator where i can control my mouse wuth arrow keys
[2013-01-10 09:30:35] <soulseekah> hold on, but why
[2013-01-10 09:30:35] <Lurker69> only once
[2013-01-10 09:30:49] <Lurker69> when you put your profile image on tweeter
[2013-01-10 09:31:07] <Lurker69> you nave little screen where you can move crop window abound
[2013-01-10 09:31:12] <soulseekah> right
[2013-01-10 09:31:13] <Grazza> just set the mouse sensitivity really low??
[2013-01-10 09:31:35] <Lurker69> in that crop window whoever was making twitter peofile moved image up dfor i pixel
[2013-01-10 09:32:02] <soulseekah> k, what of it though?
[2013-01-10 09:32:03] <Lurker69> i set my razor to lowest sensibility, will try later witl some other drivers
[2013-01-10 09:32:28] <soulseekah> the data could have been XORd after the twitter image was updated
[2013-01-10 09:32:34] <soulseekah> uploaded*
[2013-01-10 09:32:38] <Lurker69> yes
[2013-01-10 09:33:09] <Lurker69> i just wanted to reproduce exactly the same png with all same bits and same name so i can be 100% that is what cicada person did
[2013-01-10 09:33:30] <soulseekah> use Developer Tools to move the field
[2013-01-10 09:33:50] <Lurker69> othervise visually image is the same
[2013-01-10 09:34:01] <soulseekah> where did you get the image from?
[2013-01-10 09:34:07] <Lurker69> yes maybe developers tolls might help, i will try later
[2013-01-10 09:34:10] <soulseekah> and how would this all be relevant
[2013-01-10 09:34:22] <Lurker69> i am am making OTP22 drop report atm

[2013-01-10 09:51:54] <Rumel> i should read the wiki, i guess i'm only in this channel cause you mentioned it

[2013-01-10 10:10:40] <Grazza> what are /b/ raids?
[2013-01-10 10:10:56] <Lurker69> only problem with /b/ is  that you have to put alot of work in thread so it is regularly bumped, keep ontopic and filled with useful info
[2013-01-10 10:11:34] <Cosmo_> It's less about keeping it full of useful info and more about keeping it full of useful people.....
[2013-01-10 10:11:53] <Lurker69> Grazza: /b/ raids are when we have /b/ thread and we get 30 newfags inhere all asking same questions, it is nothing wrong with that but it makes this channel uselsess for csolving people at that time

[2013-01-10 10:12:40] <Lurker69> so i want to keep alternative channels off topic so  newfags dont fill them  up also and oldfags can use them if there is any progress during b reids

[2013-01-10 10:13:56] <Lurker69> programers that are resistance

[2013-01-10 10:15:07] <Lurker69> we need good  witty people that know what is going on in tosddays world and are courageous enough to resist the Big Brother
[2013-01-10 10:15:59] <Grazza> ok
[2013-01-10 10:16:01] <Lurker69> maybe we could try on anonops and voxanon networks
[2013-01-10 10:16:16] <Lurker69> but i dont want all the NSA agents that are lutking there
[2013-01-10 10:16:53] <Lurker69> voxanon is quite serious, also what is that russian anon IRXC network?
[2013-01-10 10:17:06] <Cosmo_> I've dropped the link to a couple of programmers i know at uni. I told them only head over if they're interested.

[2013-01-10 11:07:46] <Tech1_Phone> Why is there such a concern about doxing in ARGs? By other players? By the PM? Or is it the concern that TINAG
[2013-01-10 11:07:48] <Lurker69> yes but UF is good alot of lurkers if i dont post  for a week in OTP thread they came out of nowhere asking what hapened that posts stopped :-)

[2013-01-10 11:08:33] <iIIustrious> You're something of a staple there lurk
[2013-01-10 11:08:45] <Lurker69> Tech1_Phone: usuall in all ARGs people (that dontr know what args are about) try to dox PM
[2013-01-10 11:09:03] <Lurker69> and by looking for PM shills they dox all the players
[2013-01-10 11:09:31] <Tech1_Phone> ahhh, now that makes sense
[2013-01-10 11:09:35] <Tech1_Phone> ty lurk
[2013-01-10 11:09:40] <Lurker69> experienced players know that doxing PM is not part of ARG culture and is pointelss anyway
[2013-01-10 11:09:50] <iIIustrious> ^
[2013-01-10 11:09:55] <Tech1_Phone> yup
[2013-01-10 11:09:59] <Lurker69> it can brake the  game
[2013-01-10 11:10:40] <Lurker69> it is like going to teatre and while actors are on stage you would be in dressing room lokkig dfor their IDs

[2013-01-10 11:11:34] <cosmo_> Why thank you.
[2013-01-10 11:12:02] <cosmo_> I assume no one made that /b/ thread because i can't see the sentence "read the wiki" anywhere....
[2013-01-10 11:12:27] <iIIustrious> lol

[2013-01-10 11:13:44] <cosmo_> Noooo I mean we were talking about making one earlier, i assume no one did that
[2013-01-10 11:13:56] <iIIustrious> oh

[2013-01-10 11:16:55] <cosmo_> You know what disturbs me most about that?
[2013-01-10 11:17:05] <cosmo_> The fact they're using internet explorer....
[2013-01-10 11:17:18] <Grazza> lol
[2013-01-10 11:18:00] <cosmo_> I have a deal with my best friend that when i die he takes my laptop and burns my hard drive
[2013-01-10 11:18:08] <cosmo_> ......then feeds the ashes to various animals
[2013-01-10 11:18:16] <Grazza> lol
[2013-01-10 11:18:21] <Grazza> i feel like the second part is overkill
[2013-01-10 11:18:26] <Tech1_Phone> I've had to do that one IRL cosmo. Shit was weird
[2013-01-10 11:18:27] <Grazza> also that would be particularly hard
[2013-01-10 11:18:55] <cosmo_> It is clear you have not seen the contents of my hard drive. underkill if anything
[2013-01-10 11:18:58] <monadicity> just encrypt it your HD?
[2013-01-10 11:19:08] <cosmo_> NO IT MUST BURN
[2013-01-10 11:19:14] <monadicity> lol
[2013-01-10 11:19:16] <Tech1_Phone> haha
[2013-01-10 11:19:29] <Grazza> what animal eats ashes >.<
[2013-01-10 11:19:49] <cosmo_> Animals that have seen my god damn hard drive O_o
[2013-01-10 11:19:53] <Grazza> lol
[2013-01-10 11:19:57] <cosmo_> If they know what's good for them
[2013-01-10 11:19:58] <chimp> lol cosmo

[2013-01-10 11:20:04] <chimp> do you trust your friend to not snoop it before they burn it
[2013-01-10 11:20:16] <cosmo_> I trust him to be the only person more fucked up than me
[2013-01-10 11:20:30] <cosmo_> That's what best friends are for
[2013-01-10 11:20:39] <Grazza> haha
[2013-01-10 11:20:50] <Tech1_Phone> That is true
[2013-01-10 11:20:55] <cosmo_> He once snorted acid....i mean like that burny acid you find in vials in science labs
[2013-01-10 11:21:07] <chimp> sounds like an idiot, lol
[2013-01-10 11:21:10] <cosmo_> He said it hurt, so he snorted red bull to dull the pain
[2013-01-10 11:21:11] <Grazza> o.0
[2013-01-10 11:21:11] <iIIustrious> cat food is usually made partially of ash
[2013-01-10 11:21:14] <Grazza> lol
[2013-01-10 11:21:20] <iIIustrious> don't know why
[2013-01-10 11:21:32] <Grazza> did the red bull help?
[2013-01-10 11:21:32] <Tech1_Phone> because its delicious iII
[2013-01-10 11:21:39] <cosmo_> surprisingly yes
[2013-01-10 11:21:43] <Grazza> lol
[2013-01-10 11:21:44] <iIIustrious> that's weird
[2013-01-10 11:21:49] <Tech1_Phone> i dont think that redbull is very basic
[2013-01-10 11:21:59] <Tech1_Phone> couldnt have been a strong acid
[2013-01-10 11:22:01] <chimp> as long as its less acidic than whatever he snorted
[2013-01-10 11:22:09] <cosmo_> .....I think it was more the taste
[2013-01-10 11:22:12] <chimp> im sure you dont get acid particularly strong in high school science labs these days
[2013-01-10 11:22:19] <Grazza> dude
[2013-01-10 11:22:24] <Tech1_Phone> ..i dunno man, i watch breaking bad
[2013-01-10 11:22:29] <cosmo_> Ironically his name IS ash....
[2013-01-10 11:22:32] <Grazza> we had like 14m acid that we had to dilute everything with
[2013-01-10 11:22:35] <Grazza> that shit was scary
[2013-01-10 11:22:56] <cosmo_> Ash would have snorted battery acid if i'd offered him a cupcake
[2013-01-10 11:23:21] <cosmo_> ...he's now a professional hairdresser..... Go figure
[2013-01-10 11:23:23] <iIIustrious> I'm too drunk for this shit
[2013-01-10 11:23:33] <Grazza> lol
[2013-01-10 11:23:34] <chimp> hmm howl ong ago was that grazza?
[2013-01-10 11:23:36] <iIIustrious> I'll talk to you all tomorrow

[2013-01-10 11:26:18] <Grazza> lol
[2013-01-10 11:26:29] <cosmo_> .......I feel i may have pulled us slightly off topic

[2013-01-10 11:27:22] <cosmo_> if anything cool is warrented, we  should talk about skylon, or OLED's, or sound in architecture....
[2013-01-10 11:27:41] <chimp> what is skylon

[2013-01-10 11:28:44] <chimp> thats pretty sweet, does it actually get into orbit?
[2013-01-10 11:28:49] <chimp> or just fly up to orbit and come back down
[2013-01-10 11:28:57] <Tech1_Phone> Cosmo, program.
[2013-01-10 11:29:01] <Tech1_Phone> :p
[2013-01-10 11:29:34] <cosmo_> I believe it does. Either way, the engine it uses is currently in the later stages of development, a working model has been made
[2013-01-10 11:29:35] <Grazza> dang
[2013-01-10 11:29:42] <cosmo_> it's the future for aircraft and space travel

[2013-01-10 11:30:50] <cosmo_> Same.
[2013-01-10 11:31:15] <chimp> cosmo you know what else is cool
[2013-01-10 11:31:21] <cosmo_> what?
[2013-01-10 11:31:30] <chimp> interplanetary resources want to start mining asteroids in the next few decades
[2013-01-10 11:31:38] <chimp> first they are going to put a telescope in orbit to start scouting
[2013-01-10 11:31:50] <cosmo_> Oh yeah I was looking at that! Have you seen the people getting behind it?
[2013-01-10 11:31:55] <chimp> yeah some big names
[2013-01-10 11:32:02] <chimp> lots of money
[2013-01-10 11:32:05] <cosmo_> I heard james cameron was putting a fuck ton of money into it
[2013-01-10 11:32:11] <cosmo_> I laughed, then realise how much money he has
[2013-01-10 11:32:18] <Grazza> lol
[2013-01-10 11:32:33] <chimp> wasnt the goole CEO putting some cash in as well
[2013-01-10 11:32:34] <chimp> or something
[2013-01-10 11:32:38] <Grazza> yeah
[2013-01-10 11:33:00] <cosmo_> Yeah
[2013-01-10 11:33:05] <cosmo_> t's gonna be good.
[2013-01-10 11:33:24] <cosmo_> I've always wondered what happens then. I mean.... How do we stop a war on who owns what?
[2013-01-10 11:33:37] <cosmo_> Space real estate is going to become a huge issue.
[2013-01-10 11:33:53] <chimp> who knows, its not like anyone stakes a claim to the moon though
[2013-01-10 11:33:54] <Tech1_Phone> Also: kerbal space program
[2013-01-10 11:34:00] <chimp> shit yeah KSP
[2013-01-10 11:34:00] <Grazza> no idea
[2013-01-10 11:34:11] <cosmo_> You can buy part of the moon, no idea how legit
[2013-01-10 11:34:20] <Tech1_Phone> ./r/kerbalspaceprogram
[2013-01-10 11:34:23] <chimp> nah those arent legally binding in any way
[2013-01-10 11:34:41] <chimp> its not a scam because i think in teh actual documentation it basically says "ok so you dont actually get to own part of the moon"
[2013-01-10 11:34:44] <Grazza> can you claim a part of the moon if you visit it?
[2013-01-10 11:34:44] <chimp> in complicated legal speak
[2013-01-10 11:34:53] <Grazza> and how much if you can
[2013-01-10 11:34:59] <cosmo_> They should be, it'd be fucking hilarious, i bought my dad a part for £10

[2013-01-10 11:36:35] <Tech1_Phone> ^ is what i meant
[2013-01-10 11:36:39] <Grazza> lo
[2013-01-10 11:36:46] <chimp> well, one proposed area for planetary colonization is - and you probably woudnt guess it
[2013-01-10 11:36:56] <chimp> but its venus
[2013-01-10 11:36:57] <Grazza> mars?
[2013-01-10 11:37:01] <Grazza> nvm
[2013-01-10 11:37:08] <cosmo_> oh yeah the atmosphere is the most similar or something right?
[2013-01-10 11:37:11] <chimp> sounds nuts, but its not the surface of venus, which would suck
[2013-01-10 11:37:15] <chimp> yeah at about 40 km
[2013-01-10 11:37:22] <chimp> its roughly 1 atmosphere earth pressure
[2013-01-10 11:37:30] <chimp> and teh temp ranges from 0 to 40 / 50 C
[2013-01-10 11:37:34] <cosmo_> So just floating above it....
[2013-01-10 11:37:39] <chimp> yeah and because the atmosphere
[2013-01-10 11:37:48] <chimp> is almost all carbon dioxiode
[2013-01-10 11:37:51] <chimp> dioxide, its so thick and heavy
[2013-01-10 11:38:00] <chimp> an oxygen nitrogen breathing mix is a lifting gas
[2013-01-10 11:38:00] <chimp> in that atmosphere
[2013-01-10 11:38:11] <Grazza> nice
[2013-01-10 11:38:12] <Grazza> thats really interesting
[2013-01-10 11:38:30] <chimp> this guy proposed people living in aerostat colonies, floating above or just inside the sulphuric acid haze
[2013-01-10 11:38:44] <cosmo_> That is so badass
[2013-01-10 11:39:01] <cosmo_> God I love today. There is so many terrible things, but you hear stuff like that

[2013-01-10 11:46:23] <soulseekah> it's down, checked 2 minutes ago
[2013-01-10 11:46:31] <lull> okey
[2013-01-10 11:46:52] <lull> you think its down on purpose? or did they just fuck it up?
[2013-01-10 11:47:05] <soulseekah> lull, no idea, guesses don't help
[2013-01-10 11:47:07] <Tech1_Phone> Thats another dispute
[2013-01-10 11:47:12] <Tech1_Phone> yup
[2013-01-10 11:47:20] <Grazza> no one knows
[2013-01-10 11:47:32] <soulseekah> you can assume it will never be back up
[2013-01-10 11:47:44] <lull> well you´re right, cant find anything on crowley its a waste of time
[2013-01-10 11:49:17] <Tech1_Phone> maybe cicada didnt expect us to progress down the trailheads so quickly.
[2013-01-10 11:50:00] <Ymgve> they must have expected us at least soon after the twitter ended
[2013-01-10 11:50:06] <soulseekah> regardless, this is all just speculation
[2013-01-10 11:50:15] <Tech1_Phone> yeah, of course soul
[2013-01-10 11:50:20] <cosmo_> They've had a year to make this, we can assume the test is finished and we just go through it
[2013-01-10 11:50:20] <chimp> but what else can we do at this point
[2013-01-10 11:50:27] <soulseekah> there's lots of lose ends
[2013-01-10 11:50:38] <cosmo_> We can beg them for a nudge int he right direction
[2013-01-10 11:50:41] <soulseekah> keep on working with what we have
[2013-01-10 11:50:54] <Tech1_Phone> yeah, there is. the forest / trees. and 2 files from /tmp
[2013-01-10 11:50:57] <Grazza> solve the fucking poem
[2013-01-10 11:51:04] <Grazza> that thing bothers me the msot
[2013-01-10 11:51:12] <cosmo_> the parable thing?
[2013-01-10 11:51:13] <soulseekah> mp3 audio, wisdom/folly (xoring in general), break the console
[2013-01-10 11:51:17] <Grazza> ye
[2013-01-10 11:51:57] <cosmo_> Alright I'm going to take the mp3 BACK to uni today, I'm going to sit down with my housemate, the other sound guy, and we're going to rip it to shreds for the 3rd time
[2013-01-10 11:52:09] <Grazza> gl
[2013-01-10 11:52:09] <cosmo_> Because i swear i'm missing something
[2013-01-10 11:52:17] <Tech1_Phone> Glhf cosmo.
[2013-01-10 11:52:33] <cosmo_> But he needs to wake up first
[2013-01-10 11:52:39] <lull> hope you find something!
[2013-01-10 11:52:43] <soulseekah> cosmo_, did you do the left channel from right channel subtraction thing?
[2013-01-10 11:52:49] <cosmo_> Yup
[2013-01-10 11:52:54] <chimp> ill keep working on the poem and the primes, see if i can dig up any kind of connection
[2013-01-10 11:52:59] <soulseekah> wherein the cicada scream disappears completely
[2013-01-10 11:53:16] <cosmo_> That's because it's an added effect
[2013-01-10 11:53:22] <cosmo_> it's added evenly to both tracks

[2013-01-10 11:54:16] <cosmo_> I was looking at prime numbers and their connection to the golden ratio
[2013-01-10 11:54:20] <soulseekah> by evenly you mean evenly balanced (probably mono source)
[2013-01-10 11:54:24] <cosmo_> it's interesting but not really helpful
[2013-01-10 11:54:46] <cosmo_> soulseekah: yeah, the sound effect was added after the recording to both tracks at the same time
[2013-01-10 11:55:18] <cosmo_> I was trying to trace the sound effect, but that's fucking hard.
[2013-01-10 11:55:24] <chimp> i tried adding up the primes missed out by the primes output in the shell
[2013-01-10 11:55:34] <chimp> but..nothing obvious
[2013-01-10 11:55:37] <monadicity> what primes were missed out?
[2013-01-10 11:55:51] <soulseekah> 21st prime to 200th prime included
[2013-01-10 11:55:52] <chimp> its on the wiki, several rows from 79 to ~1200
[2013-01-10 11:55:54] <chimp> or there abouts
[2013-01-10 11:55:55] <Tech1_Phone> its noted somewhere
[2013-01-10 11:55:59] <soulseekah> 180 primes in total
[2013-01-10 11:56:12] <soulseekah> all missing
[2013-01-10 11:56:17] <monadicity> oh just a block of primes, not a special type of primes
[2013-01-10 11:56:23] <cosmo_> i discovered the most pointless thing about the mp3 today.
[2013-01-10 11:56:48] <cosmo_> 761 on the E flat string it's tuned to is A flat, G, E in notes
[2013-01-10 11:56:48] <Grazza> lol
[2013-01-10 11:56:49] <Tech1_Phone> anyone played with those at all? multipled / added for a web address? anything
[2013-01-10 11:56:52] <cosmo_> A G E in the console
[2013-01-10 11:56:54] <cosmo_> is 181
[2013-01-10 11:56:59] <cosmo_> a palindromic prime
[2013-01-10 11:57:40] <cosmo_> And the most pointless discovery of today goes to.... COSMO

[2013-01-10 12:01:02] <cosmo_> I don't care who cicada are, i just want them to fix my heating.
[2013-01-10 12:01:44] <Grazza> what happened to your heating?
[2013-01-10 12:01:58] <chimp> hes a student, student housing probably happened to his heating
[2013-01-10 12:02:07] <cosmo_> My housemate did. I should explain, i live with 5 guys
[2013-01-10 12:02:12] <cosmo_> All of them are insane
[2013-01-10 12:02:19] <rb9269> did you notice in the OS version the primes missed out from the onion code, are exactly 18 lines of of primes
[2013-01-10 12:02:26] <rb9269> hmm.. that sentance got away from me
[2013-01-10 12:02:48] <soulseekah> rb9269, yes, 10 primes per line
[2013-01-10 12:02:54] <chimp> yeah rb formatted into columns of 10 right
[2013-01-10 12:02:56] <chimp> yeah
[2013-01-10 12:03:15] <rb9269> yeah, doesnt that seem coincidental?
[2013-01-10 12:03:22] <rb9269> which with cicada is usually something
[2013-01-10 12:03:37] <rb9269> oh, and the double space between 29 and 31 on the onion prime list
[2013-01-10 12:03:53] <rb9269> and the other double space between 3257 and 3259
[2013-01-10 12:04:15] <soulseekah> yes, these observasion have been voiced out on several accounts
[2013-01-10 12:04:36] <soulseekah> however they don't seem to help at all
[2013-01-10 12:04:48] <chimp> we have zero idea what to do with all of these small clues
[2013-01-10 12:04:53] <soulseekah> without figuring out how to add tehm all up
[2013-01-10 12:04:54] <cosmo_> (Oh god I'm laughing so hard, I had to tell you guys but i don't want to interfere. The tv is on, and charmed, that shit series about witches is on. This episode is about a DEMONIC ICE CREAM TRUCK.... that made me laugh......but the ice cream guy is the WEIRD DOCTOR FROM SCRUBS!....it's literally the same character he plays.....but killing children with ice cream....oh my sides)
[2013-01-10 12:04:55] <chimp> or observations
[2013-01-10 12:05:01] <soulseekah> all these tiny stuff we have
[2013-01-10 12:05:27] <Grazza> lol
[2013-01-10 12:05:34] <cosmo_> If we have so many tiny thngs why does nothing connect other than primes....
[2013-01-10 12:05:55] <cosmo_> Should all the hints connect up?
[2013-01-10 12:06:02] <cosmo_> Like a forest, instead of individual trees?
[2013-01-10 12:06:04] <monadicity> http://www.baltimoresun.com/bal-te.ms.cicada10may10,0,5638148.story
[2013-01-10 12:06:28] <soulseekah> probably, but we can't seem to find the correct way to connect them up
[2013-01-10 12:06:36] <monadicity> http://oeis.org/A161664
[2013-01-10 12:06:41] <chimp> well, we have the poem each line of which sums up to primes using the table
[2013-01-10 12:06:42] <soulseekah> too many combinations, possibilities, too much noise
[2013-01-10 12:06:53] <soulseekah> yes but where do we stick this poem
[2013-01-10 12:06:56] <chimp> and the shell factors that total back into those three primes
[2013-01-10 12:07:08] <chimp> but yeah, its just noise at the moment
[2013-01-10 12:07:13] <chimp> no idea what to do with any of it
[2013-01-10 12:07:28] <chimp> and the clue about the forest / trees doesnt really help, because where / how do we apply it
[2013-01-10 12:07:29] <soulseekah> we have no obvious way to use the data we have
[2013-01-10 12:07:48] <soulseekah> lots of guess work involved, lots of trying
[2013-01-10 12:08:14] <soulseekah> convert, xor, xor, convert, reverse, offset, bla bla bla
[2013-01-10 12:08:23] <soulseekah> millions of ways to rearrange this noise
[2013-01-10 12:08:28] <Tech1_Phone> All of the missing primes add up to 110948, if it wasnt done already
[2013-01-10 12:10:01] <monadicity> Ifeel like I should have a go at this but Id need to do everything to get up to the point you all are first
[2013-01-10 12:10:04] <cosmo_> Maybe it's time for lateral think and riddle solving instead :P
[2013-01-10 12:10:16] <cosmo_> Everything we have is on the wiki dudde, seriously
[2013-01-10 12:10:32] <soulseekah> riddle solving has been in progress since day one
[2013-01-10 12:10:50] <Grazza> we should just put alll the little hints together in a page
[2013-01-10 12:10:55] <Grazza> see if we can see a pattern :p
[2013-01-10 12:11:52] <soulseekah> one of the main goals at the moment is to decrypt the DATA and wisdom/folly files
[2013-01-10 12:12:05] <soulseekah> that would yield specific, concise results
[2013-01-10 12:12:37] <soulseekah> also looking for solid chunks of hidden data in all the files we have (mp3, images, etc.)
[2013-01-10 12:12:45] <cosmo_> Well I am of no help here. GO SMART PEOPLE, GO!
[2013-01-10 12:12:57] <cosmo_> I can't do anything with that mp3 for the next couple of hours, sorry.

[2013-01-10 12:14:10] <chimp> what if?
[2013-01-10 12:14:45] <soulseekah> let's see, there are 180 missing primes, all 3 digit long right?
[2013-01-10 12:14:56] <Tech1_Phone> Not all 3 soul
[2013-01-10 12:15:06] <Tech1_Phone> 1 sec, compiling excel speadsheet. Haha
[2013-01-10 12:15:08] <soulseekah> most 3?
[2013-01-10 12:15:15] <chimp> the primes do cut off on the row where they become 3 digits
[2013-01-10 12:15:43] <chimp> so in the way they are formatted, they start on the row that starts with 3 digit primes
[2013-01-10 12:17:04] <soulseekah> it's a hefty amount of data overall

[2013-01-10 12:17:22] <Lurker69> this is OK right?
[2013-01-10 12:17:42] <Lurker69> i am posting links to it in wiki
[2013-01-10 12:17:48] <chimp> what was your line of thinking soul
[2013-01-10 12:17:49] <soulseekah> they're there already I think
[2013-01-10 12:17:57] <chimp> something encoded in 3 digit primes somehow ?
[2013-01-10 12:18:04] <soulseekah> I think that those missing primes are a xor key to one of hte data files
[2013-01-10 12:18:05] <Tech1_Phone> Wait, were there 180 missing or 181?
[2013-01-10 12:18:22] <Grazza> 181 i think
[2013-01-10 12:18:46] <Tech1_Phone> excel says 180, wondering if i missed one
[2013-01-10 12:18:46] <Lurker69> http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/Mentioned_PRIMES
[2013-01-10 12:18:47] <soulseekah> in any case, it's one of the heftier chunks of clue that we have
[2013-01-10 12:18:54] <Grazza> nvm
[2013-01-10 12:18:55] <soulseekah> 180 digits
[2013-01-10 12:19:10] <Lurker69> http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/What_We_Know#Telneting_PRIMES   LIST OF MISSING PRIMES
[2013-01-10 12:19:35] <chimp> its worth trying , people have already xord everything with everything
[2013-01-10 12:19:54] <Grazza> but how can you hide something in a list of primes?
[2013-01-10 12:20:14] <soulseekah> no you use them to xor one of the encrypted files we have
[2013-01-10 12:20:17] <soulseekah> to reveal info
[2013-01-10 12:20:19] <Grazza> o
[2013-01-10 12:20:26] <soulseekah> ther eare sevearl ways to go about converting them to data though
[2013-01-10 12:20:39] <Grazza> k im out
[2013-01-10 12:20:41] <soulseekah> I did try plain space separated ascii
[2013-01-10 12:20:48] <soulseekah> agains everything yesterday
[2013-01-10 12:20:52] <soulseekah> but stopped there
[2013-01-10 12:21:07] <soulseekah> now I'm thinking of transforming them to something else
[2013-01-10 12:21:14] <soulseekah> like hex values
[2013-01-10 12:21:25] <soulseekah> or each prime's factors
[2013-01-10 12:21:51] <soulseekah> not many sane transormations possible without getting carried away
[2013-01-10 12:21:56] <soulseekah> so worth exploring
[2013-01-10 12:22:03] <Tech1_Phone> Moving excel to google docs

[2013-01-10 12:53:19] <Ymgve> anyone tested stuff with 1183811 and 118818811?
[2013-01-10 12:53:32] <Ymgve> the file sizes of two of the data files
[2013-01-10 12:53:48] <Ymgve> curiously enough, the third data file is not of size prime
[2013-01-10 12:55:06] <Ymgve> also, what's up with the file names 560.xx
[2013-01-10 12:56:13] <Tech1_Phone> the .13 and .17 is easy enough
[2013-01-10 12:56:29] <Tech1_Phone> Not sure about 560 though.
[2013-01-10 12:56:33] <Lurker69> what is rh name of that files?
[2013-01-10 12:56:36] <Lurker69> 560?
[2013-01-10 12:56:39] <Lurker69> yes
[2013-01-10 12:56:43] <Lurker69> why 560?
[2013-01-10 12:56:51] <Lurker69> it must be uber important
[2013-01-10 12:57:10] <Lurker69> since cicada didnt use prime for filename
[2013-01-10 12:57:11] <Tech1_Phone> well, if we assume 13 and 17 are the cycles of cicadas, 560 may be a specific classification of cicada?
[2013-01-10 12:57:22] <Lurker69> also why _ infront of _560.00
[2013-01-10 12:57:33] <Lurker69> and why .00   00 is not ptime
[2013-01-10 12:57:33] <Tech1_Phone> *year cycles
[2013-01-10 12:58:22] <Lurker69> some popople were looking at generations of cicadas that re comming from the groung this year
[2013-01-10 12:58:31] <soulseekah> speaking of _ remember that console interprets _
[2013-01-10 12:58:32] <Lurker69> they are active in NE US i think
[2013-01-10 12:58:37] <Lurker69> dont have links
[2013-01-10 12:59:01] <Lurker69> maybe _560.00 it this year
[2013-01-10 12:59:18] <Tech1_Phone> Its not lurk, but it it makes us put the files in a specific order. 00 being genesis (maybe cycle 1 of cicadas, then 13 years later .13?
[2013-01-10 12:59:27] <Lurker69> 560.13 and 560.17  are next generations
[2013-01-10 13:00:05] <Lurker69> which of these three files we didnt use yet
[2013-01-10 13:00:18] * Lurker69 still didnt xor single file  at cicada
[2013-01-10 13:00:56] <Tech1_Phone> I think soul did a buch of xors with the 3 files.
[2013-01-10 13:01:09] <Tech1_Phone> Every combination of the 3, i'd imagine
[2013-01-10 13:02:02] <soulseekah> but only 1 pass
[2013-01-10 13:02:08] <soulseekah> i.e. one file with one file
[2013-01-10 13:02:26] <soulseekah> atm I'm working on xoring the missing primes against everything
[2013-01-10 13:03:05] <Lurker69> no i meant... as i understand we used only two of those three DATA files for now
[2013-01-10 13:03:20] <Tech1_Phone> I think xoring them in order (or cicada life cycles) would be worth looking into
[2013-01-10 13:03:24] <Lurker69> one wasnt used to produce any image or message at all
[2013-01-10 13:03:50] <Lurker69> try to focus on files we didnt get anything from them yet
[2013-01-10 13:04:42] <soulseekah> data-wise we used a miniscule amount of bytes
[2013-01-10 13:04:48] <soulseekah> compared to what's left
[2013-01-10 13:05:11] <Ymgve> oh, of course 13 and 17 are the cicada cycles
[2013-01-10 13:05:19] <Ymgve> not that it helps much with anything
[2013-01-10 13:05:33] <Tech1_Phone> No, but it gives us an order for the files doesn't it?
[2013-01-10 13:05:52] <Tech1_Phone> or at least, a minor clue
[2013-01-10 13:05:54] <Ymgve> I also note that _560.00 which is not prime size is close to the mp3 in size
[2013-01-10 13:06:46] <Lurker69> um i remebere i still didnt open that linux splash screen
[2013-01-10 13:07:12] <Tech1_Phone> We didnt xor that with anything yet either
[2013-01-10 13:07:14] <Lurker69> does anybody have link hoe to edit that bmp like format or i have to research it
[2013-01-10 13:07:44] <Lurker69> none of my software opens i by defoult
[2013-01-10 13:07:56] <Ymgve> it's a very custom format
[2013-01-10 13:08:01] <Lurker69> i found some links but didnt intall them yet i would like PS addon
[2013-01-10 13:08:12] <Ymgve> http://frantisek.rysanek.sweb.cz/splash/isolinux-splash-HOWTO.html
[2013-01-10 13:08:38] <Tech1_Phone> What was the extension again?
[2013-01-10 13:08:52] <Ymgve> .rle
[2013-01-10 13:09:07] <Ymgve> but that document uses .lss
[2013-01-10 13:09:27] <Lurker69> http://filext.com/file-extension/RLE
[2013-01-10 13:09:37] <Lurker69> oh its lss
[2013-01-10 13:10:02] <Lurker69> i will do it in next window of freetime
[2013-01-10 13:10:12] <Tech1_Phone> Yomobo.net/bootsplash ctrl f rle
[2013-01-10 13:12:24] <Tech1_Phone> Apparently ifran will open rle as well

[2013-01-10 13:14:13] <Tech1_Phone> The boot splash image cosmo
[2013-01-10 13:14:40] <Tech1_Phone> trying to work that, the primes, and on to something with the 560.13, 00 and 17 files....kinda
[2013-01-10 13:14:50] <Tech1_Phone> *missing primes
[2013-01-10 13:14:53] <cosmo_> Oh ok cool
[2013-01-10 13:15:16] <Tech1_Phone> well, found rle to png converter if that helps

[2013-01-10 15:20:04] <Lurker69> nothing to see here move along
[2013-01-10 15:20:12] <Lurker69> we have secret club now
[2013-01-10 15:20:32] <Kokosnuss> If I'm around when it gets solved, I'm gonna log out and probably take a nap, then be excited
[2013-01-10 15:20:55] <Lurker69> i am closing the channel and putting password on it, then we will post /b/ images in  chanell and circlejerk
[2013-01-10 15:21:31] <Lurker69> seriously
[2013-01-10 15:21:56] <Lurker69> for noe it looks like everybody that is interested to at least try to solve the puzles will be able to finsh it
[2013-01-10 15:22:07] <Lurker69> we are sharing as we should
[2013-01-10 15:22:33] <Lurker69> out coders a are shring scripts and providing  help to all people who arent skilled in certain fiesld

[2013-01-10 15:22:48] <Lurker69> also wiki is starting to get some form
[2013-01-10 15:23:06] <Lurker69> all we have to figure out is:
[2013-01-10 15:23:19] <Lurker69> Did we miss a clue  (i am sure we did)
[2013-01-10 15:23:23] <Cosmo_> WHO WAS PHONE?!
[2013-01-10 15:23:26] <Cosmo_> .....oh...right
[2013-01-10 15:23:27] <Cosmo_> and that
[2013-01-10 15:23:28] <Lurker69> Do we have to recruit more pople
[2013-01-10 15:23:51] <Lurker69> Why onion2 is down and how to put it back again
[2013-01-10 15:24:26] <Grazza> how will we know what the password is :O
[2013-01-10 15:24:30] <Lurker69> Does cicada wait for us to unvcover another clue  or  does cicada wati untl  playerbase reach certain number od candidates
[2013-01-10 15:24:31] <Grazza> if we arent on when you put it on lol
[2013-01-10 15:24:32] <Tech1> These all sound like decent ideas
[2013-01-10 15:24:57] <Tech1> use the 2nd onion address or something
[2013-01-10 15:25:01] <Tech1> if we take that course
[2013-01-10 15:25:06] <Cosmo_> If there's another group, who's furthest?
[2013-01-10 15:25:25] <Tech1> unknown
[2013-01-10 15:25:27] <Lurker69> and we have to fing clues in materail we already have but we didnt use for anything yet
[2013-01-10 15:25:31] <Tech1> no way to know TBH
[2013-01-10 15:25:34] <Lurker69> like folly and wisdom
[2013-01-10 15:25:42] <Grazza> imma figure out that poem
[2013-01-10 15:25:44] <Tech1> and the odd file naming
[2013-01-10 15:25:45] <Grazza> if it kills me
[2013-01-10 15:25:48] <Lurker69> and that  one DATA file that wasnt used in xoring yet
[2013-01-10 15:26:00] <Lurker69> and palindromes
[2013-01-10 15:26:05] <Kokosnuss> Is there another group? Searching, this is the only one i found. And besides, i doubt they'd take everyone from a group
[2013-01-10 15:26:06] <Lurker69> and primes
[2013-01-10 15:26:33] |<-- Cosmo_ has left freenode (Quit: Page closed)
[2013-01-10 15:27:14] <Lurker69> Kokosnuss: i dont have any reason to suspest about another group...  didnt find any posts from them anywhere nor didnt notice that people from this channel will begin to be strangely absent
[2013-01-10 15:27:29] <Tech1> Koko: id also be willing to bet if there was another group, there would be members in this chan in both
[2013-01-10 15:28:02] <Lurker69> last year you could notice peple being recruited to secret groups when good coders begin to dissapear from public channels
[2013-01-10 15:28:15] <Lurker69> usually the coder stry to do that
[2013-01-10 15:28:33] <Kokosnuss> I would expect that too, but I'd also think that members of both would keep quiet about the other
[2013-01-10 15:29:15] <Lurker69> when all the researchers and other people tell them the clues and coders sknoe what to code, they tend to do code and dont share it sometimes...  but lets hope this wont happen this year
[2013-01-10 15:29:48] <Lurker69> Kokosnuss: for now i think there is no toher secret group
[2013-01-10 15:30:00] <Lurker69> except lurkers from cicada from last year
[2013-01-10 15:30:04] <Lurker69> and real cicada
[2013-01-10 15:30:14] <Kokosnuss> But you're right, there aren't any signs of another group
[2013-01-10 15:30:44] <Kokosnuss> In fact, I'd suspect cicada watching us on this room
[2013-01-10 15:30:51] <Lurker69> usually groups start to form whne main channel is spammed so hard that serious people cant use it for work
[2013-01-10 15:31:08] <Kokosnuss> But as i said earlier this morning, I'm a naturally paranoid person
[2013-01-10 15:31:08] <Lurker69> that is why we have few other public channels in tpic
[2013-01-10 15:31:28] <Lurker69> we all are a bit paranoid
[2013-01-10 15:31:38] <Lurker69> and we actually have good resons
[2013-01-10 15:32:48] <Kokosnuss> Do you also suspect cicada being in here?
[2013-01-10 15:33:00] <Tech1> Its not paranoia if they are really out to get you
[2013-01-10 15:33:10] <Tech1> im almost positive koko
[2013-01-10 15:33:35] <Grazza> ^
[2013-01-10 15:33:59] <Ymgve> its me im the cicada spy
[2013-01-10 15:35:15] <Kokosnuss> Tech 1 i messages you
[2013-01-10 15:35:48] <Lurker69> people who solved puzzle last year (speculation is that it was about 30 of them) are surely interested to see what is going on in thirs game this  year
[2013-01-10 15:36:19] <Lurker69> i havent seen anybody to come here and say: hey guys i solved this shirt lasy year good luck
[2013-01-10 15:36:26] <Lurker69> i wonder why
[2013-01-10 15:36:37] <Kokosnuss> I'm almost sure of it too. As i said, they probably won't recruit everyone in the group. They're looking for who they want
[2013-01-10 15:36:56] <Lurker69> no it is fair
[2013-01-10 15:37:06] <Lurker69> iy you solve the puzzle you get invited
[2013-01-10 15:37:25] <Lurker69> well i hpe it is like that and it makes sense

[2013-01-10 15:38:13] <Lurker69> and to solve the puzzle you have to spend quite some time on this and do  some research....

[2013-01-10 15:42:17] <Kokosnuss> Yea, and the only thing keeping us from moving forward is that we don't know what to do next. How is the XORing coming? Wikia.com is blocked at my school, and Tor doesn't work either
[2013-01-10 15:42:25] <Lurker69> despite all the secret grpoups i was able to solve almost everything with help ony from public channells
[2013-01-10 15:42:43] <Kokosnuss> Yea, you guys are great :)
[2013-01-10 15:43:05] <Lurker69> people from secret groups  slipped allot of times and if you were checking the logs it was all posted in there
[2013-01-10 15:43:36] <Lurker69> only difference was that secret groups had secret wikis, there was no public wiki last year
[2013-01-10 15:43:42] <Lurker69> only clevcode.org
[2013-01-10 15:44:01] <Lurker69> and he stopped posting after he got his firts mail
[2013-01-10 15:44:08] <Kokosnuss> Fail. Do you think the difficulty from last year turned off as many people from trying this year?
[2013-01-10 15:44:22] <Lurker69> yes
[2013-01-10 15:44:40] <Tech1> I'd guess it cut down on a number of people who didnt know what they were doing and refused to learn
[2013-01-10 15:44:44] <Kokosnuss> That may be why we haven't heard of secret groups. Less lips to be loose
[2013-01-10 15:44:52] <Tech1> but then, i wasnt involved last year either
[2013-01-10 15:45:07] <Lurker69> last year we had  about 50 kids/leet hackers from hackforums   this year hackforums doesnt want to participate
[2013-01-10 15:45:21] <Lurker69> i posted few times there but hardly any reply

[2013-01-10 16:58:10] <Lurker69> http://www.reddit.com/r/a2e7j6ic78h0j/   but is is wvery similar to last years cicadas reddit

[2013-01-10 16:58:30] <dyadic> this subreddit's first post was posted 7 days ago though, on the 3rd I guess
[2013-01-10 16:58:37] <dyadic> before cicada started?
[2013-01-10 16:58:56] <rr645> Lurker, that IS last year's cicada reddit

[2013-01-10 17:06:04] <spyne> if you represent all the missing primes as their hex values, can it be compared with other data such as wisdom and folly?
[2013-01-10 17:06:06] <Lurker69> You can't see the forest when you're looking at the trees.

[2013-01-10 17:06:51] <Lurker69> i am thinkig...  what if xoring is not only operation used here
[2013-01-10 17:06:51] <spyne> has it been attempted?
[2013-01-10 17:07:08] <spyne> that's what I thought as well
[2013-01-10 17:07:26] <spyne> the book is called "The Book of Wisdom OR Folly"
[2013-01-10 17:07:28] <Lurker69> spyne, i think yes but i am not sure, i didnt xor single file, but we hwv 4 or five people who tried lots of stuff

[2013-01-10 17:09:25] <Grazza> my internet sucks
[2013-01-10 17:09:25] <Lurker69> i think tahat missing primes  werent tried for xoring yet
[2013-01-10 17:09:27] <spyne> it's not listed, but they prob have tried many more things
[2013-01-10 17:10:39] <Kokosnuss> Yea, I doubt they recorded everything
[2013-01-10 17:10:59] <rr645> I like the idea of or'ing wisdom and folly instead of xor'ing
[2013-01-10 17:11:01] <Lurker69> then again you can xor three  things together...  and you can xor with offset...  you bust know that with xoring wit hoffst you get completely different zresults
[2013-01-10 17:11:21] <Lurker69> and you have to recognizze result as some filetype when you see is
[2013-01-10 17:11:22] =-= rr645 is now known as rr645-away
[2013-01-10 17:11:24] <Lurker69> it*
[2013-01-10 17:11:40] <Kokosnuss> I would laugh so hard if it ends up we don't have to XOR anything
[2013-01-10 17:11:51] <dyadic> if you or wisdom and folly you will get the same thing since they are the same files I think?
[2013-01-10 17:11:53] <Lurker69> ^
[2013-01-10 17:12:09] <Lurker69> they are not the same
[2013-01-10 17:12:13] <spyne> well considering the fact that wisdom and folly are exactly identical, I don't know what can come out of ORing or XORing
[2013-01-10 17:12:14] <rr645-away> if you xor them, not or them
[2013-01-10 17:12:31] <spyne> they are not?
[2013-01-10 17:12:41] <dyadic> I thought the wiki said they were

[2013-01-10 17:13:14] <Lurker69> that thing i wiki is wroong
[2013-01-10 17:13:21] <monadicity> yeah you can take one file A and random data R and then give one person A xor R and another person R
[2013-01-10 17:13:33] <Lurker69> wisdom.32 is the same as wisdom.txt
[2013-01-10 17:13:42] <dyadic> ah
[2013-01-10 17:13:43] <Lurker69> there are 4 files i think
[2013-01-10 17:13:47] <monadicity> then basically they both have totally random data.. but xoring it together gives back the file sA

[2013-01-10 17:15:01] <monadicity> has that been used for anything?
[2013-01-10 17:15:21] <monadicity> they are primes
[2013-01-10 17:15:28] <spyne> not an expert, could we "add" the contents of wisdom and folly to get something else?

[2013-01-10 17:24:34] <Tech1> sudden idea: Re: Linode server / subnet issues
[2013-01-10 17:24:53] <Tech1> linode is probably only filling holes in their ip range with each new server.
[2013-01-10 17:25:05] <Tech1> i doubt that the two onions are back to back
[2013-01-10 17:25:07] <Tech1> or even in the same subnet
[2013-01-10 17:25:23] <Lurker69> no, it hink cicada planned to take down the tor
[2013-01-10 17:25:52] <Tech1> it's appearing that way lurk
[2013-01-10 17:25:54] <Lurker69> we just have to figure out what triggered it  or what will trigger it be be back
[2013-01-10 17:26:07] <Lurker69> only patience wont solve much of a puzzle
[2013-01-10 17:26:18] <Tech1> i think the theory of 'they only wanted X people to have the info'
[2013-01-10 17:26:26] <Tech1> maybe it's more of a test of disemnination of info than the actual info
[2013-01-10 17:26:33] <Tech1> hence, the forest from the trees
[2013-01-10 17:27:02] <Lurker69> there are two ways we can go
[2013-01-10 17:27:17] <Lurker69> 1. make wiki secret and dont recrruit any new people
[2013-01-10 17:27:34] <Lurker69> 2. make thng begginer friendal and recruit more troops
[2013-01-10 17:27:50] <Lurker69>  i am down for any of those if we reach some concensus
[2013-01-10 17:28:18] <monadicity> Lurker69, you know the thing about cicadas only coming out on prime number occasions though?
[2013-01-10 17:28:25] <monadicity> maybe it's related to that
[2013-01-10 17:28:32] <Lurker69> yes it is
[2013-01-10 17:28:37] <Tech1> woah

[2013-01-10 17:28:47] <Tech1> so we can expect onion tomorrow?

[2013-01-10 17:28:58] <monadicity> could be that
[2013-01-10 17:29:01] <dyadic> some period of lcm of a set of primes?
[2013-01-10 17:29:02] <monadicity> will have to wait

[2013-01-10 17:29:08] <monadicity> oh man
[2013-01-10 17:29:15] <monadicity> maybe it will be up and down over a long period

[2013-01-10 17:33:47] <Tech1> if that's the case, we could expect 2nd onion in a few hours
[2013-01-10 17:34:12] <Tech1> ..oh
[2013-01-10 17:34:15] <Grazza> its like 1 am in japan
[2013-01-10 17:34:16] <Tech1> or 1 hour and 33 minutes ago

[2013-01-10 17:56:41] <zebra> well if it's only going to be up on primes then it can't be up tuesday
[2013-01-10 17:57:02] <Tech1> so we can possibly expect to see it up tomorrow.  the dispute is what timezone is used for the calculation.

[2013-01-10 19:04:09] <Ymgve> we know exactly what those numbers mean

[2013-01-10 19:08:50] <Lurker69> how discovered port 80 on tor 1?   was it in any cicadas message or we foiound it by scanning/luck ?

[2013-01-10 19:11:41] <Tech1> yeah
[2013-01-10 19:11:43] <zebra> Maybe it will come back up on the 17th?
[2013-01-10 19:11:48] <zebra> It's a prime.
[2013-01-10 19:11:53] <Ymgve> was onion1 down too?
[2013-01-10 19:11:56] <Tech1> so is the 11th
[2013-01-10 19:11:59] <Ymgve> my memory is a bit hazy
[2013-01-10 19:12:08] <Tech1> IIRC no ym
[2013-01-10 19:12:25] <zebra> Ya but I just guessed 17 because of the number 7, since someone thought it would be tuesday because of 7 letters in it, 7 seems important.
[2013-01-10 19:12:41] <Tech1> it's such a low prime though, you'll find it everywhere if you look
[2013-01-10 19:12:56] <zebra> hmm, Maybe the onion 2 is useless.
[2013-01-10 19:13:01] <Ymgve> the number 7 only became up because of "7 virtues"
[2013-01-10 19:13:09] <Tech1> from the book right?
[2013-01-10 19:13:12] <Ymgve> which is a pretty weak connection
[2013-01-10 19:13:26] <zebra> Ya I know, but it was a nice theory about tuesday
[2013-01-10 19:13:26] <Ymgve> from catholics

[2013-01-10 19:14:28] <Tech1> on speed
[2013-01-10 19:14:31] <zebra> The only thing the second onion said was "patience is a virtue"?
[2013-01-10 19:14:38] <Tech1> and a comment in the html
[2013-01-10 19:15:05] <zebra> What was the comment?
[2013-01-10 19:15:05] <Ymgve> patience is like patient, a patient is in an asylum, asylum creates bad movies, we need to see which movies theyve put out lately
[2013-01-10 19:15:20] <zebra> I dont follow that.
[2013-01-10 19:15:22] <Ymgve> zebra: "that means, please come back later" or something like that
[2013-01-10 19:15:34] <zebra> Ya I know what it means, but I dont understand the movie thing.
[2013-01-10 19:15:50] <Ymgve> zebra: it's the same kind of far fetch logic that led you from patience to a week day
[2013-01-10 19:16:04] <zebra> OK good point.
[2013-01-10 19:17:59] <Gibemoneyplos> Did we run the .mp3 through a spectography?

[2013-01-10 19:45:16] <Kokosnuss> Where did the b binary come from originally?
[2013-01-10 19:45:22] <zebra> The pastebin could be a troll though.
[2013-01-10 19:45:34] <zebra> I have no idea kokosnuss, I just saw the binary
[2013-01-10 19:45:38] <Kokosnuss> No PGP?
[2013-01-10 19:45:38] <zebra> No clue where it came from.
[2013-01-10 19:45:46] <zebra> On the warning there is no pgp
[2013-01-10 19:46:19] <Kokosnuss> Whoever wrote the warning probably didn't want to be identified
[2013-01-10 19:46:39] <zebra> Just went through my history, found binary link

[2013-01-10 19:46:52] <lull> kokonuss i do not have a text, i asked my teacher about this and he tried it on 95! as for the information he told me, i find it hard to be not true!

[2013-01-10 20:47:37] <indigo_|School> Gibemoneyplos : That might just be the way notepad interperates it.  Try a hex editor like Notepad++ and see what comes up

[2013-01-10 20:47:57] <Ymgve> indigo_|School: notepad++ isn't a hex editor
[2013-01-10 20:48:32] <indigo_|School> Ymgve : Then what would it be considered, and what is an example of a hex editor (Not being rude, guenionly curious)
[2013-01-10 20:48:44] <Ymgve> indigo_|School: notepad++ is a text editor
[2013-01-10 20:48:51] <Ymgve> hex workshop is an example of a hex editor
[2013-01-10 20:49:01] <Ymgve> Cinemo: and the point?
[2013-01-10 20:49:03] <Gibemoneyplos> I'm usually using 010 Editor
[2013-01-10 20:49:19] <indigo_|School> Ymgve : What is the technical diff between Notepad and Notepad++?
[2013-01-10 20:49:22] <Cinemo> It gave me an idea, you see gentlemen, I am a film maker. A hobbyist. An amateur. I do it for the sake of art instead of profits. And this premise, a group of young people, cracking a weird puzzle by a mystical group really seems to be a good concept. I'd like to make a movie about you.
[2013-01-10 20:49:49] <indigo_|School> Cinemo : That sounds very interesting
[2013-01-10 20:49:57] <Ymgve> indigo_|School: notepad is a buitin program in windows, notepad++ is an alternative open source text editor with many more features
[2013-01-10 20:50:01] <Gibemoneyplos> Cinemo : Sounds fun

[2013-01-10 20:50:25] <Ymgve> Cinemo: you should also check out the unfiction forums
[2013-01-10 20:50:27] <indigo_|School> Ymgve : Would you consider it a source code editor
[2013-01-10 20:50:37] <Cinemo> Unfiction forums?
[2013-01-10 20:50:39] <Ymgve> indigo_|School: yes, source code is text
[2013-01-10 20:51:05] <Ymgve> Cinemo: it's the main place where people discuss these kinds of puzzles/ARGs
[2013-01-10 20:51:15] <indigo_|School> Ymgve : Alright, do hex editors interperate hex code in a specific way?
[2013-01-10 20:51:33] <Ymgve> there is no "hex code"
[2013-01-10 20:51:48] <Ymgve> text editors treat whatever you open as ascii text
[2013-01-10 20:51:56] <Gibemoneyplos> Guise, how do I determine the way that files are encrypted? I'm pretty new to this
[2013-01-10 20:51:59] <Ymgve> hex editor shows you the raw bytes, written in hexadecimal
[2013-01-10 20:52:14] <indigo_|School> Ymgve : Alright, I understand what you are understanding
[2013-01-10 20:52:23] <Ymgve> Gibemoneyplos: there's not even anything indicating they are encrypted
[2013-01-10 20:52:26] <Cinemo> Anyway, most of the movie would be "on the internet" in a chatroom such as this. And the characters would only be known for their "nicknames". Also thank you, I will check out these forums. But for the time being, I will lay low here, and observe. If anyone has a story they wish to share, or their interesting personal experience with this, feel free to share.
[2013-01-10 20:52:39] <indigo_|School> Ymgve : So the hex code happenes to match up with the hex code for chinese letters in windows so thats why is displays them/

[2013-01-10 20:55:57] <Ymgve> indigo_|School: well that's probably because you're online when you should pay attention in class

[2013-01-10 20:56:54] <Gibemoneyplos> Ymgve : I suppose you've seen other filetypes written in some kind of pseudo-chinese when opened with notepad - any previous experience with these?
[2013-01-10 20:57:47] <Ymgve> Gibemoneyplos: anything that appears random, like compressed and encrypted stuff, will look like "chinese"
[2013-01-10 20:57:52] <Cinemo> Since there doesn't seem to be much traffic currently I'll ask a question. What do you guys think, who are the Cicada? Are they good or bad? Do you believe that "leaked" document trashing them?
[2013-01-10 20:58:18] <Ymgve> Gibemoneyplos: it's no more surprising than finding printable ascii characters in a hex dump
[2013-01-10 20:58:29] <Gibemoneyplos> Cinemo : Did you see this? http://pastebin.com/dHJ6JNkr
[2013-01-10 20:58:44] <Ymgve> Gibemoneyplos: that was what he was refering to
[2013-01-10 20:58:52] <Gibemoneyplos> Heh, lel
[2013-01-10 20:58:53] <Cinemo> Yes. The Gentleman is right.
[2013-01-10 20:58:55] <lulzorz> Cinemo: leaked doc doesn't trash them, it's just about a guy who didn't agree with some of what he thought they were about
[2013-01-10 20:59:10] <lulzorz> it shows they have a lot of good ideas
[2013-01-10 20:59:17] <Cinemo> So what do you guys think about it?
[2013-01-10 20:59:26] <lulzorz> and since it matches the leaked email from last year, I think it's at least somewhat legit
[2013-01-10 20:59:51] <Ymgve> If it is anything, it's basically freemasonry for nerds
[2013-01-10 21:00:02] <indigo_|School> Ymgve : I take mandarin in school, and I could tell you that some of thoes charecters, were certinly chinese.  I do understand that it was a conisidence, but they actually were chinese chars
[2013-01-10 21:00:38] <Ymgve> indigo_|School: let me put it this way: http://codeseekah.com/cicada/folly.32.txt
[2013-01-10 21:00:55] <Ymgve> you can see that there are certainly english characters in the right column there
[2013-01-10 21:01:07] <Ymgve> that doesn't mean the data is in english
[2013-01-10 21:01:30] <Lurker69> cicada are about freedom of information, if you consider that good or bad is that  your personal opinion, but it is worth mentioning that governments doesnt allow freedom of information and are marking hacktivicsts as terorists sometimes 
[2013-01-10 21:01:37] <Tech1> i miss anything?  parents called and decided they needed comptuer tech support
[2013-01-10 21:01:41] <Ymgve> likewise, that there are chinese characters when a document is being treated as _if it was_ in chinese (when it actually isn't) it's not surprising chinese chars pop up
[2013-01-10 21:01:41] <Tech1> that was frustrating
[2013-01-10 21:02:12] <Ymgve> Lurker69: I don't believe that tho
[2013-01-10 21:02:25] <Ymgve> real "freedom fighters" online are out in the open
[2013-01-10 21:02:27] <indigo_|School> Ymgve : I see, that makes more sense
[2013-01-10 21:02:45] <Lurker69> Cinemo: http://boards.4chan.org/sci/res/5414358#p5427528 here is a bit about it
[2013-01-10 21:03:02] <Ymgve> they have names that "everyone" knows like Appelbaum and Assange and Stallman

[2013-01-10 21:03:25] <Lurker69> Ymgve: true that many "freedom fighters are on the open" but that doesnt mean that there arent some fredom fighters under the radar
[2013-01-10 21:04:05] <indigo_|School> Not related, but anyone hear about anonomous trying to get DDOSing recognized as free speech
[2013-01-10 21:04:13] <Ymgve> lol
[2013-01-10 21:04:14] <Lurker69> also if cicada would be government agency (gad guys) they could just hire people and pay then normal wagec, they dont have to recruit on 4chan
[2013-01-10 21:04:23] <Absence_> nothing new on wiki? We still in the same spot from 3 days ago?
[2013-01-10 21:04:36] <Ymgve> Absence_: yes
[2013-01-10 21:04:37] <indigo_|School> Absence_ :  Pretty Much, yes sir
[2013-01-10 21:04:45] <Ymgve> and my virtuous patience is running low
[2013-01-10 21:05:04] <Lurker69> out of patience
[2013-01-10 21:05:05] <Tech1> ^^
[2013-01-10 21:05:35] <Cinemo> Interesting. So none of you would say that the Cicada is "bad"?
[2013-01-10 21:06:06] <Absence_> Lurker69 : Government doesn't take operation recruitment to the masses its ground troops. BigBrother keeps a selective eye, if they needed help, they wouldn't look at places on the internet, surface web atleast, to recruit people.
[2013-01-10 21:06:06] <Lurker69> people who think Cicada is bad are not here
[2013-01-10 21:06:07] <indigo_|School> Ymgve : Your wisdom is showing, but do be to conseedid, as wisdom can easily turn into folly
[2013-01-10 21:06:15] <Lurker69> didnt click on IRC link mostly
[2013-01-10 21:06:24] <Absence_> They would review the actions of selective people on the internet, but never take advertise directly.

[2013-01-10 21:07:02] <Cuboid3301> hey guys
[2013-01-10 21:07:10] <Ymgve> most government organizations put up job applications in the open
[2013-01-10 21:07:21] <Tech1> i'm neutral on the good / bad thing becuase i'm not 100% sure where they stand
[2013-01-10 21:07:24] <Ymgve> even for semi-secret stuff
[2013-01-10 21:07:25] <Tech1> best we got is a pastebin
[2013-01-10 21:07:34] <Lurker69> * job applications*
[2013-01-10 21:07:35] <Tech1> define semi-secret ymgve
[2013-01-10 21:07:41] <Absence_> Thats in case highly intelligent people want to approach them.
[2013-01-10 21:07:43] <Ymgve> http://www.nsa.gov/careers/
[2013-01-10 21:07:49] <Lurker69> ^
[2013-01-10 21:08:10] <Ymgve> you get a description like "we are looking for reverse engineering experts versed in x86"
[2013-01-10 21:08:11] <Tech1> that's info that can be released
[2013-01-10 21:08:12] <Gibemoneyplos> >Intelligence. It's the ability to think abstractly. Challenge the unknown. Solve the impossible.
[2013-01-10 21:08:14] <Ymgve> but not specific
[2013-01-10 21:08:37] <Tech1> yes, and?  malware is a big thing right now // cyberwar
[2013-01-10 21:08:59] <Ymgve> that's what I mean
[2013-01-10 21:09:04] <Tech1> and i'm sure the CI part as well, reversing
[2013-01-10 21:09:05] <Ymgve> governments don't need to recruit in secret
[2013-01-10 21:09:19] <Ymgve> for those positions at least
[2013-01-10 21:09:24] <Tech1> unles cicada is an interview
[2013-01-10 21:09:51] <Ymgve> if it was, they would try to attract much more people
[2013-01-10 21:09:52] <Tech1> they don't necesicarily want people with degrees out the ass and all kinds of certs
[2013-01-10 21:09:55] <Ymgve> like that GCUQ thing
[2013-01-10 21:09:59] <Ymgve> err, GCHQ
[2013-01-10 21:10:06] <Gibemoneyplos> I agree with what Ymgve said earlier - that it's a freemasonry for nerds
[2013-01-10 21:10:18] <Absence_> Likely that.
[2013-01-10 21:10:22] <Tech1> they want skill, sometimes degree / certs don't give it to you
[2013-01-10 21:10:25] <Absence_> Honestly, it probably is.
[2013-01-10 21:10:28] <Tech1> gchq/
[2013-01-10 21:10:29] <Tech1> ?
[2013-01-10 21:10:35] <Ymgve> http://www.canyoucrackit.co.uk/ <-- that's how the GCHQ did it
[2013-01-10 21:10:54] <indigo_|School> Also social skills, and cooperating on this irc shows that, as I assume they're watching this channel
[2013-01-10 21:11:30] <Cuboid3301> Hmmm.... Folly seems to have a lot of Japanese Kanji characters
[2013-01-10 21:11:52] <Ymgve> Cuboid3301: welcome to my explanation earlier

[2013-01-10 21:12:11] <Cuboid3301> Oh haha I didn't see it
[2013-01-10 21:12:26] <Absence_> If it isnt some activist or masonry group its NSA, doubt the UK is trying again.
[2013-01-10 21:12:28] <Ymgve> _any_ binary data with significant randomness will have chinese/japanese characters in it
[2013-01-10 21:12:31] <Cinemo> So... how do you know they aren't one of you? How do you know it's not me?
[2013-01-10 21:12:54] <monadicity> GCHQ have been making public statements about recruitment
[2013-01-10 21:13:00] <Gibemoneyplos> Cinemo : I guess we don't - that's the thing with anonymity
[2013-01-10 21:13:01] <Cuboid3301> So you are saying that the files are random?
[2013-01-10 21:13:01] <monadicity> this isn't their style at all though
[2013-01-10 21:13:02] <Tech1> so has NSA
[2013-01-10 21:13:07] <Absence_> It isn't you because you just said that, Cinemo.
[2013-01-10 21:13:17] <indigo_|School> Absence_ : 4chan is browsed by mostly people from the USA, but maybe I'm wrong
[2013-01-10 21:13:20] <Ymgve> Cuboid3301: same entropy as random data
[2013-01-10 21:13:33] <Cuboid3301> Ok
[2013-01-10 21:13:35] <Ymgve> which means either it _is_ random, compressed, or encrypted
[2013-01-10 21:13:56] <Gibemoneyplos> Hm
[2013-01-10 21:13:58] <Cinemo> Maybe I said that to throw suspicion off of me... Well... Seems to be a lot of blind faith... Considering your only "idea" on what they do is a pastebin that may or may not be real.
[2013-01-10 21:14:05] <Gibemoneyplos> Because there's two of the same file
[2013-01-10 21:14:06] <monadicity> > either random compressed or encrypted
[2013-01-10 21:14:06] <Cuboid3301> My guess is encrypted knowing Cicada
[2013-01-10 21:14:08] <Gibemoneyplos> I'm leaning towards random tbh
[2013-01-10 21:14:09] <Tech1> also, the number of people who visit 4chan that would qualify for a TS-SCI w/ lifestyle poly, are few
[2013-01-10 21:14:14] <monadicity> glad we could cut down the options xD
[2013-01-10 21:14:15] <Tech1> i doubt it's NSA
[2013-01-10 21:14:16] <Absence_> and i highly doubt Cicada lives in croatia.
[2013-01-10 21:14:18] <Absence_> Highly.
[2013-01-10 21:14:22] <Ymgve> Cinemo: we don't need faith, we just solve puzzles
[2013-01-10 21:14:25] <Absence_> Or uses t-mobile.
[2013-01-10 21:14:27] <Lurker69> http://images.4chan.org/sci/src/1357848811831.jpg
[2013-01-10 21:14:46] <Ymgve> Cinemo: no matter if they're good or bad, we're not furthering their cause just by solving these things
[2013-01-10 21:15:53] <Cinemo> Why do you do it then? Recognition? A pat on the back among yourselves?
[2013-01-10 21:15:56] <Gibemoneyplos> Have anyone tried to run the linux binary thing without folly & wisdom?
[2013-01-10 21:16:05] <dyadic> Ymgve: sorry, was away.  to which files were you referring?
[2013-01-10 21:16:16] <Ymgve> Cinemo: because it's a fun challenge
[2013-01-10 21:16:17] <Absence_> We do it because we have interest in it.
[2013-01-10 21:16:29] <Ymgve> it's like asking "why do people solve crosswords"
[2013-01-10 21:16:30] <Tech1> challenge / learning
[2013-01-10 21:16:30] <Absence_> Why do you want to make it seem as if we're in this for self reasons?
[2013-01-10 21:16:45] <Ymgve> dyadic: I'm talking about files in general
[2013-01-10 21:16:47] <Absence_> If we wanted rcognition Ymgve would not contribute anything.

[2013-01-10 22:11:06] <Ymgve> Lurker69: there was
[2013-01-10 22:11:20] <Lurker69> where
[2013-01-10 22:11:33] <Ymgve> 560.13 has _very_ obvious patterns at the start

[2013-01-10 22:12:03] <Ixateht> <dyadic> the sizes of those data files are both primes
[2013-01-10 22:12:09] <Lurker69> we suspected it based on usage of xor in various computes ciphers, but last year there were no xoring
[2013-01-10 22:12:10] <Ixateht> i noticed that too

[2013-01-10 22:12:27] <Lurker69> but that padding  was vwry abvious ayou are right
[2013-01-10 22:13:15] <Ymgve> also "offset 0" would have been a very obvious hint about using the start of files

[2013-01-10 22:18:16] <Ymgve> Lurker69: when it comes to xor pads, you basically have the formula random + random = sensible data

[2013-01-10 22:18:32] <Ymgve> and using algebra, sensible data + random = random

[2013-01-10 22:19:21] <dyadic> Ixateht: interesting
[2013-01-10 22:19:38] <Ymgve> like it was mentioned, "xoring" with the full iso works, but that's just because it's xoring with a bunch of 00s
[2013-01-10 22:19:54] <Ymgve> and the offset doesn't matter
[2013-01-10 22:19:59] <BneogurIs> you should try atleast

[2013-01-10 22:26:27] <BneogurIs> im sure its a prime!
[2013-01-10 22:26:28] <Ixateht> why is each line 76 bytes, but the last one is not a full line?
[2013-01-10 22:27:20] <Ymgve> Ixateht: because the resulting jpeg's size isn't divisible by 65
[2013-01-10 22:27:21] <Ixateht> and we xor'd ~4MB of data from the mp3 into 560.13 but less than 64k is png and padding

[2013-01-10 23:23:11] <monadicity> :/

[2013-01-10 23:25:48] <monadicity> yeah so it does take about
[2013-01-10 23:25:54] <monadicity> 5 seconds or something
[2013-01-10 23:26:03] <monadicity> to test a single onion address by socks resolution
[2013-01-10 23:26:22] <monadicity> too slow

[2013-01-10 23:43:31] <Ymgve> I didn't reveal the real address of onion2
[2013-01-10 23:43:49] <iIIustrious> wasn't it soul?
[2013-01-10 23:43:52] <Absence_> uuhh
[2013-01-10 23:43:53] <soulseekah> bi
[2013-01-10 23:43:54] <soulseekah> no
[2013-01-10 23:43:58] <Ymgve> that was NikTitanik
[2013-01-10 23:43:59] <soulseekah> was someone elsse
[2013-01-10 23:44:07] <Absence_> did we set a focus theory on what the hint message means
[2013-01-10 23:44:32] <Ymgve> no
[2013-01-10 23:44:47] <Ymgve> it kinda feels like 3301 messed up the "hello" message
[2013-01-10 23:44:59] <Ymgve> that it was supposed to be xored and unreadable
[2013-01-10 23:45:10] <soulseekah> well there's been plenty of time to fix it
[2013-01-10 23:45:21] <Ymgve> yeah
[2013-01-10 23:45:30] <Ymgve> which is weird
[2013-01-10 23:45:37] <Absence_> Well a forest isn't just the trees, its the details. Its the life, the events, etc.
[2013-01-10 23:45:46] <Ymgve> why leave onion1 up and take onion2 down
[2013-01-10 23:45:56] <iIIustrious> the phrase means the opposite absence
[2013-01-10 23:46:01] <soulseekah> Ymgve, I have this crazy theory, but I need 24 hours to prove it wrong :)
[2013-01-10 23:46:03] <iIIustrious> it means stop looking at the details
[2013-01-10 23:46:23] <Ymgve> soulseekah: what, you got a time when you think it will activate again?
[2013-01-10 23:46:38] <soulseekah> I think that onion2 comes up for a bit every now and then, we're just missing it
[2013-01-10 23:46:50] <Absence_> :o
[2013-01-10 23:47:24] <soulseekah> I have monitorig setup to ping its linode host every mintue
[2013-01-10 23:47:38] <soulseekah> not sure whether depending on it still bein on linode is sane
[2013-01-10 23:47:43] <soulseekah> though
[2013-01-10 23:47:46] <Ymgve> it's not
[2013-01-10 23:48:00] <Ymgve> I'l certain it will change hosts
[2013-01-10 23:48:07] <Kokosnuss> Hey, how much have you guys messed around with the terminal
[2013-01-10 23:48:11] <Kokosnuss> ?
[2013-01-10 23:48:13] <soulseekah> a lot :)
[2013-01-10 23:48:14] <Ymgve> quite a lot
[2013-01-10 23:48:16] <Ymgve> why
[2013-01-10 23:48:43] <Lurker69> http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/Tweeter,_XORing,_Gematria_Primus_and_two_TOR_adresses#ONION_2
[2013-01-10 23:48:49] <Kokosnuss> I'm on it now, the Java one on codeseekah's site, and I noticed something
[2013-01-10 23:48:54] <Lurker69> ymgve how did you fix comment tag?
[2013-01-10 23:49:02] <Lurker69> i can just check source i guess
[2013-01-10 23:49:05] <Ymgve> Lurker69: html entities like I said
[2013-01-10 23:49:11] <Ymgve> &lt; for < and &gt; for >
[2013-01-10 23:49:16] <soulseekah> Kokosnuss, http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/TELNET_ONION_OUTPUTS everything we know pretty much is here
[2013-01-10 23:49:20] <Lurker69> ok thks
[2013-01-10 23:49:32] <soulseekah> Kokosnuss, what did you notice?
[2013-01-10 23:50:10] <Ymgve> soulseekah: btw have you looked into exactly what makes it behave differently when asked to get a .txt?
[2013-01-10 23:50:24] <Kokosnuss> I kept typing in one thing. One thing I knew wasn't a command. I'd expect it to give me the same error message every time
[2013-01-10 23:50:34] <iIIustrious> it won't
[2013-01-10 23:50:39] <soulseekah> Kokosnuss, read the wiki, all errors are there
[2013-01-10 23:50:43] <Ymgve> no, there are like 6 different error messages
[2013-01-10 23:50:46] <soulseekah> all six of them listed,
[2013-01-10 23:50:55] <soulseekah> they are output at random
[2013-01-10 23:51:22] <Kokosnuss> But if it were a proper terminal, it would give me the error that's most applicable, right?
[2013-01-10 23:51:34] <soulseekah> Kokosnuss, it's a scripted prompt
[2013-01-10 23:51:41] <soulseekah> reacting to what you type it
[2013-01-10 23:51:55] <soulseekah> and its scripted to pick error messages at random
[2013-01-10 23:52:17] <Kokosnuss> It just spit a lot out at me O.O
[2013-01-10 23:52:37] <Kokosnuss> 2 41
[2013-01-10 23:52:41] <Kokosnuss> 2 2 2 13
[2013-01-10 23:52:46] <Kokosnuss> 5 29
[2013-01-10 23:52:48] <soulseekah> Ymgve, I have continued to look into the extensions anomalies but it's a dead end, and the behavior seems to have slightly changed around 2 days ago wherein it started speweing out errors even without an extension
[2013-01-10 23:52:49] <Kokosnuss> 2 3 31
[2013-01-10 23:52:53] <Kokosnuss> 2 2 2 2 13
[2013-01-10 23:53:06] <Kokosnuss> 3 83
[2013-01-10 23:53:08] <soulseekah> Kokosnuss, that Java terminal should not be deemed reliable
[2013-01-10 23:53:17] <Kokosnuss> ok
[2013-01-10 23:53:19] <soulseekah> use your native telnet client instead
[2013-01-10 23:53:33] <soulseekah> clearnet address is codeseekah.com on port 3301
[2013-01-10 23:56:08] <iIIustrious> or just use tor? It's pretty simple to use in this case

[2013-01-10 23:57:45] <Kokosnuss> got it
[2013-01-10 23:58:26] <Kokosnuss> Do we have a list of significant numbers anywhere?

[2013-01-11 00:17:41] <Kokosnuss> 2012 was their big next show up, right>
[2013-01-11 00:17:57] <Kokosnuss> "<scrounger> Hey, this is weird, and relates to the prime numbers again:  "Magicicada is the genus of the 13-year and 17-year periodical cicadas of eastern North America. " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodical_cicada"

[2013-01-11 03:01:56] <lulzorz> soulseekah: you should just set up port 3301 to proxy requests into the tor network
[2013-01-11 03:02:11] <soulseekah> no thanks, I'd rather not do that
[2013-01-11 03:03:24] <lulzorz> it would be a lot simpler
[2013-01-11 03:04:53] <soulseekah> explain?
[2013-01-11 03:05:36] <lulzorz> not sure which tool would be the best, but I think you can do it with socat

[2013-01-11 03:06:07] <soulseekah> it's of no use

[2013-01-11 03:06:28] <lulzorz> people don't need to run tor
[2013-01-11 03:06:38] <lulzorz> they can just connect to your server

[2013-01-11 05:46:37] <anon420> has anybody try finding the value of the missing primes in the rune table/
[2013-01-11 05:47:12] <iIIustrious> there would be a large number of possibilities for each one
[2013-01-11 05:47:30] <iIIustrious> entire words, and on the larger ones, sentances
[2013-01-11 05:47:39] <anon420> the rune table must have a function damn it
[2013-01-11 05:54:32] <Grazza> the function with the rune table is to make you think there is a function when there isnt :O
[2013-01-11 05:58:08] <anon420> ok but clearly we must decipher something using the rune table like maybe the parable
[2013-01-11 05:59:06] <lulzorz> it's a one-way function
[2013-01-11 05:59:28] <lulzorz> also, the lines of the parable multiplied together are the parable number
[2013-01-11 05:59:31] <Grazza> maybe decode something to find a number which can be a url?
[2013-01-11 06:00:03] <lulzorz> numbers can't be turned into URLs
[2013-01-11 06:00:14] <Grazza> www.123577.com?
[2013-01-11 06:00:26] <lulzorz> unless they're big enough to be ASCII or something
[2013-01-11 06:00:29] <lulzorz> oh, yeah, domain name
[2013-01-11 06:00:30] <lulzorz> that's different
[2013-01-11 06:00:32] <Grazza> srry
[2013-01-11 06:00:49] <lulzorz> yeah, that was done last year
[2013-01-11 06:00:56] <lulzorz> could certainly be possible this year
[2013-01-11 06:01:07] <Grazza> TRY ALL THE NUMBERS
[2013-01-11 06:01:19] <lulzorz> but I think everyone is organizing their records while waiting for the onion to come back up
[2013-01-11 06:01:38] <anon420> The general method that Crowley used to interpret the obscurities of Liber AL was the Qabalah, especially its numerological method of gematria

[2013-01-11 06:30:41] <unRealElite> I remember that Julian Assange was really into crypto games back when he was in college, I wonder if he is a member of 3301, Jacob Applebaum seems to have the similar mindset of a 3301 member also.

[2013-01-11 06:53:56] <zebra> When dudeY said it was a troll, was it from the same ip as when he posted?

[2013-01-11 07:55:11] <unRealElite> btw, does zenmap work over a TOR connection?
[2013-01-11 07:55:15] <iIIustrious> I tried telnet and netcat
[2013-01-11 07:55:19] <bakpak2hvy> you could probably get it to
[2013-01-11 07:55:21] <Tech1> pretty sure you can use torify
[2013-01-11 07:55:27] <iIIustrious> it's not refused on port 80, but doesn't give you anything
[2013-01-11 07:55:37] <iIIustrious> and no requests I sent through were answered
[2013-01-11 07:55:39] <bakpak2hvy> telnet doesnt work for me
[2013-01-11 07:56:02] <bakpak2hvy> doesnt look like the source gives us anything either
[2013-01-11 07:56:09] <iIIustrious> really doesn't
[2013-01-11 07:56:25] <bakpak2hvy> maybe its another patience thing
[2013-01-11 07:56:36] <iIIustrious> then why change the wording
[2013-01-11 07:56:38] <soulseekah> well it looks like the clearnet address is setup to not reply
[2013-01-11 07:56:47] <unRealElite> they could still be trying to get their shit together
[2013-01-11 07:56:47] <iIIustrious> yep
[2013-01-11 07:56:55] <Tech1> yeah, exactly what i'm getting
[2013-01-11 07:56:56] <bakpak2hvy> unRealElite: maybe so
[2013-01-11 07:57:01] <soulseekah> unRealElite, I doubt that they're unprepared

[2013-01-11 07:57:36] <unRealElite> can I apt-get torify?
[2013-01-11 07:57:37] <soulseekah> using torify
[2013-01-11 07:57:42] <soulseekah> torify comes with tor
[2013-01-11 07:57:55] <soulseekah> torsocks is a wrapper around torify in newer versions
[2013-01-11 07:57:58] <soulseekah> use those
[2013-01-11 07:59:07] <soulseekah> start trying different paths

[2013-01-11 08:05:05] <bakpak2hvy> it said all are filtered

[2013-01-11 08:42:10] =-= zebra_away is now known as zebra
[2013-01-11 08:42:14] <n_factor> oh rly?
[2013-01-11 08:42:24] <n_factor> i dont get a Welcome back.?
[2013-01-11 08:42:26] <soulseekah> yes, like 15 minutes ago I think
[2013-01-11 08:42:34] <unRealElite> but there's nothing but a welcome message on onion2
[2013-01-11 08:42:36] <soulseekah> everyone's busy
[2013-01-11 08:42:40] <unRealElite> so there's that
[2013-01-11 08:42:44] <n_factor> hmm
[2013-01-11 08:43:04] <n_factor> can you connect to other ports on an onion address?
[2013-01-11 08:43:13] <soulseekah> someone's scannign ports
[2013-01-11 08:43:17] <n_factor> or is it one port per hidden service address
[2013-01-11 08:43:18] <soulseekah> but so far no only port 80
[2013-01-11 08:43:20] <unRealElite> so far only port 80 as open
[2013-01-11 08:43:29] <soulseekah> no n_factor there may be many ports
[2013-01-11 08:43:34] <n_factor> well what do we know about 80
[2013-01-11 08:43:39] <n_factor> it says it's Apache
[2013-01-11 08:43:51] <soulseekah> n_factor, we know that it's a linode machine again
[2013-01-11 08:43:52] <n_factor> but doesnt give a version
[2013-01-11 08:43:53] <n_factor> thats unusual
[2013-01-11 08:43:56] <soulseekah> different IP though
[2013-01-11 08:44:00] <n_factor> could be
[2013-01-11 08:44:17] <n_factor> unless they moved it and have it reporting the wrong machine
[2013-01-11 08:44:25] <n_factor> because they knew it was self doxing
[2013-01-11 08:44:33] <soulseekah> well it's self doxing again
[2013-01-11 08:44:41] <n_factor> yeah
[2013-01-11 08:44:44] <unRealElite> here's the error

[2013-01-11 08:46:05] <soulseekah> because the error pages are perfect
[2013-01-11 08:46:07] <unRealElite> soulseekah: possibly a file name related to anything in The Book of the Law?
[2013-01-11 08:46:10] <n_factor> yeah
[2013-01-11 08:46:15] <soulseekah> and if it's fake then they dox themselves on purpose
[2013-01-11 08:46:21] <soulseekah> writing those error messages
[2013-01-11 08:46:27] <soulseekah> then again that address may be fake
[2013-01-11 08:46:36] <soulseekah> unRealElite, of course, everythign is possible
[2013-01-11 08:46:45] <n_factor> did you try primes?
[2013-01-11 08:46:49] <n_factor> for filenames
[2013-01-11 08:46:57] <soulseekah> n_factor, Tech1 bruteforced the 1st 1000
[2013-01-11 08:47:04] <soulseekah> with several known extentions
[2013-01-11 08:47:09] <soulseekah> I'm doing manual guesswork for now
[2013-01-11 08:47:15] <soulseekah> that's pretty much it

[2013-01-11 08:47:35] <n_factor> it was worth a shit
[2013-01-11 08:52:24] <n_factor> it drops connection after about 15 seconds
[2013-01-11 08:52:27] <n_factor> thats a short timeout for apache
[2013-01-11 08:52:36] <n_factor> when you connect and do nothing
[2013-01-11 08:52:43] <unRealElite> I noticed that myself
[2013-01-11 08:55:10] <unRealElite> I'm looking at the /x/ thread right now, looks like they're going off on a tangent about Pleiades and the hex codes inside the OP's image.
[2013-01-11 08:55:16] <Gibemoneyplos> So what can we use the fact that 2. TOR-link is up again to? What are they planning?
[2013-01-11 08:56:14] <unRealElite> considering that the onion is only up on a prime date, maybe what we're looking for will only appear at a prime minute or hour at GMT -6 ?

[2013-01-11 08:57:03] <soulseekah> no
[2013-01-11 08:57:14] <soulseekah> still exploring
[2013-01-11 08:58:01] <unRealElite> so we're sure that GMT -6 is where either the person doing this or the servers set to do this is located right?
[2013-01-11 08:58:26] <soulseekah> unRealElite, we can't be sure of anything
[2013-01-11 08:58:33] <Tech1-Phone> Well, server cam back online at about 730
[2013-01-11 08:58:45] <Tech1-Phone> Assuming the date change...puts it at GMT-6
[2013-01-11 08:59:08] <Tech1-Phone> it may have been earlier it came online, we just didnt notice

[2013-01-11 09:00:09] <Tech1-Phone> So the page was changed, then they waited to turn it on?
[2013-01-11 09:00:32] <unRealElite> so does that throw my hour theory out the window?
[2013-01-11 09:00:39] <soulseekah> maybe, I don't think it is of crucial relevance atm
[2013-01-11 09:00:46] <soulseekah> and I doubt that it will ever be
[2013-01-11 09:01:14] <iIIustrious> it didn't come up early
[2013-01-11 09:01:17] <Tech1-Phone> The server being on only on prime day may or may not be, we'll see tomorrow
[2013-01-11 09:01:21] <iIIustrious> I was checking it every 2 minutes

[2013-01-11 10:46:54] <Ymgve> anything interesting there?
[2013-01-11 10:46:57] <soulseekah> not yet
[2013-01-11 10:47:00] <soulseekah> working on it
[2013-01-11 10:47:03] <soulseekah> it just says welcome
[2013-01-11 10:47:15] <soulseekah> but I'm trying to bruteforce some files out in the path
[2013-01-11 10:47:30] <soulseekah> nothing interesting in headers or anything
[2013-01-11 10:47:39] <soulseekah> besides the fact that apache error pages are like last time
[2013-01-11 10:47:47] <soulseekah> only this time host has different linode ip
[2013-01-11 10:48:00] <soulseekah> and it doesn't respond on the clearnet
[2013-01-11 10:48:04] <soulseekah> but is pingable
[2013-01-11 10:48:13] <Gibemoniplos> At work, so it'll take some time
[2013-01-11 10:48:15] <soulseekah> other than that all seems unpeculiar
[2013-01-11 10:48:52] <Cosmo> Hmm..... Well it's something that it's back at least
[2013-01-11 10:49:15] <Cosmo> 'Welcome back'...No one would have lft if it hadn't gone down.
[2013-01-11 10:49:17] <Ymgve> assume you've tried netcat-ing it?
[2013-01-11 10:49:36] <soulseekah> Ymgve, yep, regular Apache server it seems
[2013-01-11 10:49:49] <soulseekah> also some folks done portscans nothing interesting
[2013-01-11 10:53:17] <Tech1> I checked first 1k primes in dir names, html, and jpg extensions
[2013-01-11 10:53:54] <soulseekah> I'm doing dictionary bruteforce of several extensions (an no extensions) too
[2013-01-11 10:54:43] <Tech1> hm.. i wonder if we should xor the html source against something?
[2013-01-11 10:55:05] <soulseekah> not much to xor, it's under 100 bytes
[2013-01-11 10:55:26] <Tech1> we've used a ton of xor, to be honest, i think xor is done. we have proved we know how to xor
[2013-01-11 10:55:46] <Tech1> ah, that is a valid point as well
[2013-01-11 10:56:17] <Ymgve> I think it might be used once more
[2013-01-11 10:56:24] <Ymgve> they haven't used the "skip" part yet
[2013-01-11 10:56:40] <Ymgve> not the offset either, for that matter
[2013-01-11 10:56:52] <Ymgve> (the hello message doesn't count)
[2013-01-11 10:56:54] <Tech1> True
[2013-01-11 10:57:11] <Tech1> that was 3301 offset?
[2013-01-11 10:57:16] <Tech1> I recall?
[2013-01-11 10:58:28] <soulseekah> yeh
[2013-01-11 11:00:13] <Tech1> Hmmm
[2013-01-11 11:00:26] <Tech1> So basically, unless the 2nd onion changes again, or we find another shell...we are at the same point as 24 hours ago
[2013-01-11 11:00:49] <Ymgve> yeah
[2013-01-11 11:00:57] <Ymgve> and 48 hours ago
[2013-01-11 11:01:00] <Ymgve> and 72 hours ago
[2013-01-11 11:01:03] <Tech1> Haha
[2013-01-11 11:01:07] <Tech1> yeah
[2013-01-11 11:01:28] <soulseekah> well we can now look for files too
[2013-01-11 11:01:35] <iII|afk> I'm going to be running some of the higher digit paliprimes here in a bit, I'll let you know what comes out
[2013-01-11 11:01:44] <soulseekah> which is quite fun for a change (too much xoring)

[2013-01-11 13:50:00] <dyadic> just noticed there's a weird peak in the mp3's spectrum, way outside all the other harmonics
[2013-01-11 13:50:43] <dyadic> around ~15639 to 15641 hz (which is a prime)

[2013-01-11 13:55:48] <dyadic> it has pretty high energy
[2013-01-11 13:55:55] <Lurker69> is it treu theat onion2 is back?

[2013-01-11 13:57:00] <dyadic> also, did anybody notice that 560 is congruent to 1 modulo 13, and congruent to -1 modulo 17?
[2013-01-11 13:59:07] <Tech1> Ya know....i think we're still stuck..
[2013-01-11 13:59:21] <Ymgve> dyadic: damn, that's something we totally missed
[2013-01-11 13:59:31] <Ymgve> not that it helps us tho
[2013-01-11 13:59:57] <Tech1> interesting though
[2013-01-11 14:00:09] <dyadic> I'm not sure what everyone is focusing on atm really, still trying to catch up with what's going on
[2013-01-11 14:00:32] <Tech1> onion cam up at 0630 GMT
[2013-01-11 14:00:33] <Ymgve> waiting for onion2 to change, mostly
[2013-01-11 14:00:35] <Tech1> today
[2013-01-11 14:00:40] <Ymgve> Tech1: exactly?
[2013-01-11 14:00:40] <Tech1> thats been about it
[2013-01-11 14:00:43] <Ymgve> oh btw
[2013-01-11 14:00:45] <Tech1> right around
[2013-01-11 14:01:28] <Tech1> i have logs at home, will check. or better yet, check with iII. he has the exact time +- 2 min
[2013-01-11 14:01:31] <Ymgve> when I verify their signatures with pgp it says "Signature made 01/03/13 05:33:29 W. Europe Standard Time"
[2013-01-11 14:01:54] <Ymgve> does it say EST because I'm in it or did it get signed in EST too?
[2013-01-11 14:02:35] <Tech1> w europe standard is GMT / Zulu
[2013-01-11 14:02:47] <Ymgve> oh right
[2013-01-11 14:02:57] <Tech1> so... + 6 from you
[2013-01-11 14:03:09] <Ymgve> nah, -1
[2013-01-11 14:03:13] <Ymgve> I'm in CET
[2013-01-11 14:03:23] <Tech1> oooh, i thought you said est. :p
[2013-01-11 14:03:32] <Tech1> im in cet as well.
[2013-01-11 14:03:40] <Ymgve> I did but I got my abbreviations confused
[2013-01-11 14:03:47] <Ymgve> but does that come out exactly the same when others verify=
[2013-01-11 14:04:00] <Tech1> ahh thats a valid point. i get ya.
[2013-01-11 14:04:08] <Tech1> sadly im the wrong person as well
[2013-01-11 14:04:26] <Tech1> we need someone in the states / not CET

[2013-01-11 14:04:50] <Ymgve> not that it matters much except maybe pinpointing the timezone of 3301
[2013-01-11 14:05:34] <Tech1> Yeah, we have that theory, but no one is sure that its relevant
[2013-01-11 14:06:30] <dyadic> the parable from the id3 tag sounds like it's describing a molting process, I've been thinking this implies steganography?  has anything been found in the mp3 other than the id3 stuff?
[2013-01-11 14:07:11] <Tech1> Dyadic: it was used in an xor
[2013-01-11 14:07:32] <Tech1> as far as in: talk to cosmo when hes around
[2013-01-11 14:07:50] <dyadic> ok thanks
[2013-01-11 14:08:01] <Tech1> hes another audiophile dude
[2013-01-11 14:09:52] <Tech1> Ym: I meant the stuff I was throwing around last night, 2nd onion up on primes. I estimated the time it went down, and got a rough timezone
[2013-01-11 14:10:45] <Tech1> * server used timezone, not actual location
[2013-01-11 14:16:05] <Lurker69> so...  onion2 ver 2   lokks similar thatn onion2 ver 1  but it is actually totaly different (different IP diferent server) AIMRITE?
[2013-01-11 14:16:44] <Lurker69> OLD onion2 ver 2 Apache/2.2.22 (Ubuntu) Server at li528-4.members.linode.com Port 81</address>

[2013-01-11 14:21:19] <Lurker69> but IP lookup i all the same

[2013-01-11 14:31:09] <dyadic> hmm so on this second onion address, it just runs factor and a couple other things?
[2013-01-11 14:34:45] <Ymgve> no, that's the first one
[2013-01-11 14:34:59] <Ymgve> the second now just says "welcome back"
[2013-01-11 14:35:21] <Ymgve> which is kinda stupid, because we never went anywhere
[2013-01-11 14:38:50] <Lurker69> i am not sure if that onion 2 change (down time and new server setting up) was time dependednd and planned in advance, or did that happen because of some of our "actions"
[2013-01-11 14:40:28] <Lurker69> but it looks like  onion 2 ver2 will be much different than onion2 ver1, we just didnt find the main defference; that Apache/2.2.22 (Ubuntu) =/=Apache Server  isnt only chande i persume

[2013-01-11 14:46:44] <Lurker69> so there is a bit more important change than that apache ver differnce
[2013-01-11 14:47:05] <Kokosnuss> Anything in the past hour or so?
[2013-01-11 14:47:06] <Lurker69> Kokosnuss: onion 2 is back

[2013-01-11 14:49:59] <Kokosnuss> Sweet. Just a matter of time
[2013-01-11 14:50:19] <Tech1> i ran first 1k primes as directories and html and jpg no luck.

[2013-01-11 14:51:15] <Tech1> Well, maybe.
[2013-01-11 14:51:26] <Tech1> right now we dont have a damn thing on the 2nd onion

[2013-01-11 15:27:21] <dyadic> yeah we need to know what to send
[2013-01-11 15:28:16] <Tech1> is there a remote interface for django?

[2013-01-11 15:50:28] <Lurker69> i am posting all things in pastebin 8for search fuction) and in pastee or maybe anonpaset so our people from china can see it
[2013-01-11 15:50:45] <Lurker69> it would be nice for other to do the same for all links in wiki
[2013-01-11 15:51:05] <Lurker69> BTW, with TOR you can onpen pastebin rigt?  or no
[2013-01-11 15:51:47] <srbsrb> there shouldn't be any problem opening it
[2013-01-11 15:51:49] <srbsrb> i think
[2013-01-11 15:52:16] <Lurker69> i am also not sure exactly
[2013-01-11 15:52:34] <Lurker69> srbs have you seen C3 video about governemnts blocking tor

[2013-01-11 15:53:37] <Lurker69> http://forums.unfiction.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=981922#981922  i posted then here look at on about tor blocking, china is doing great at blocking it
[2013-01-11 15:53:54] <srbsrb> aah those
[2013-01-11 15:54:08] <srbsrb> i was going to see them yesterday but i fel asleep
[2013-01-11 15:55:02] <lulzorz> the governments blocking tor talk is the best of 28C3 and probably the best from the CCC in several recent years
[2013-01-11 15:55:09] <srbsrb> why would you block tor? that makes no sense
[2013-01-11 15:55:14] <srbsrb> i'll watch it now
[2013-01-11 15:55:15] <lulzorz> (which is saying a lot, CCC is pretty much got-tier)
[2013-01-11 15:55:44] <lulzorz> it's pretty much a complete overview of governmental attacks on the internet
[2013-01-11 15:55:48] <Kokosnuss> I'm not actually in China, just feels like it with the internet blocks my school uses
[2013-01-11 15:56:04] <lulzorz> Kokosnuss: what gear do they use?

[2013-01-11 15:57:38] <lulzorz> Kokosnuss: run a bridge from home...or just get one from the list
[2013-01-11 15:57:38] <Kokosnuss> That used to work
[2013-01-11 15:57:57] <Kokosnuss> No internet at home. What list
[2013-01-11 15:57:59] <Kokosnuss> ?
[2013-01-11 15:58:42] <lulzorz> the bridge list, from the tor website
[2013-01-11 15:58:54] <lulzorz> it should work unless they block https
[2013-01-11 15:59:38] <lulzorz> blocking https is saying, "we insist on seeing every byte you see, you are not capable of acting in your own interests or authorized to keep any secrets from us"
[2013-01-11 16:00:16] <Kokosnuss> HTTPS isn't blocked, I'll look at that when i get home

[2013-01-11 16:01:07] <lulzorz> or was it Iraq?
[2013-01-11 16:01:13] <iIIustrious> So, I can confirm that the first thousand primes don't work with nearly any extension, I'm making a list of the larger paliprimes to keep trying
[2013-01-11 16:01:41] <srbsrb> i cant run tor with chrome right? i have to download firefox?
[2013-01-11 16:02:05] <iIIustrious> chrome can, it's just so much easier to get the browser bundle
[2013-01-11 16:02:14] <iIIustrious> which includes firefox
[2013-01-11 16:02:20] <lulzorz> yeah, get the browser bundle fo sho
[2013-01-11 16:02:33] <srbsrb> oh ok thanks

[2013-01-11 16:36:18] <NikTitanik> you should have done it discretely. write it on a piece of paper and put it somewhere for it to be found

[2013-01-11 16:51:53] <Kokosnuss> I don't have the capabilities at the moment. In fact, I'm not sure how much time I have left, either. Less than 40 min for sure

[2013-01-11 16:52:42] <Kokosnuss> 2x3x5x3x2 is 180
[2013-01-11 16:52:53] <Kokosnuss> They said they only scanned primes
[2013-01-11 16:53:16] <Kokosnuss> maybe those are the factors for the port. Where did those numbers come from, lulzorz?

[2013-01-11 17:08:39] <iIIustrious> ok, ok, reading back
[2013-01-11 17:08:47] <iIIustrious> we did NOT only try prime ports
[2013-01-11 17:08:57] <Kokosnuss> ?
[2013-01-11 17:08:59] <iIIustrious> we tried thousands of thenm
[2013-01-11 17:09:03] <Kokosnuss> Was that a suggestion then
[2013-01-11 17:09:03] <Kokosnuss> ?
[2013-01-11 17:09:05] <iIIustrious> reasonably all of them
[2013-01-11 17:09:19] <iIIustrious> we also tried the url\*.jpg
[2013-01-11 17:09:27] <iIIustrious> where * is the first thousand primes
[2013-01-11 17:09:35] <iIIustrious> as well as .txt, png, html
[2013-01-11 17:10:02] <iIIustrious> the only port anyone said seems to be open is 80, which doesn't do much
[2013-01-11 17:10:04] <lulzorz>  /, not \
[2013-01-11 17:10:14] <lulzorz> lrn2html

[2013-01-11 17:10:21] <iIIustrious> you get the goddamn point, haha
[2013-01-11 17:10:39] <lulzorz> that's WORSE THAN .HTM
[2013-01-11 17:10:52] <Kokosnuss> What's wrong with .htm?
[2013-01-11 17:10:56] <chimp> evening all
[2013-01-11 17:11:03] <chimp> damn, progress?
[2013-01-11 17:11:09] <dyadic> what monadicity said, has anybody tried port-knocking
[2013-01-11 17:11:26] <Kokosnuss> we have someone scanning all 65k
[2013-01-11 17:11:27] <lulzorz> Kokosnuss: it's the result of MS's lazy 8.3 decision
[2013-01-11 17:11:29] <iIIustrious> I think they only port scanned
[2013-01-11 17:11:31] <iIIustrious> kok
[2013-01-11 17:11:32] <iIIustrious> o
[2013-01-11 17:11:38] <iIIustrious> that was yesterday
[2013-01-11 17:11:48] <lulzorz> iIIustrious: they didn't report yet
[2013-01-11 17:11:52] <Kokosnuss> To Google to find the difference!
[2013-01-11 17:11:53] <lulzorz> so I assume it's ongoing
[2013-01-11 17:12:13] <iIIustrious> bakpak did, said nothing, but screwed it up by only trying the first 200
[2013-01-11 17:12:27] <iIIustrious> I'm pretty sure soul reported last night that none were open, no?
[2013-01-11 17:12:51] <Kokosnuss> Ok, so, scanning is looking for open ports, knocking is looking for closed ports that could be opened if authenticated with?
[2013-01-11 17:13:45] <dyadic> knocking is sending syn's (or something else) in sequence to a set of ports, whereupon another port will be opened to connect to
[2013-01-11 17:14:05] <Kokosnuss> Ok
[2013-01-11 17:15:07] <lulzorz> the idea is that you can talk to a server through only SYNs
[2013-01-11 17:15:10] <monadicity> my guess is the (missing) primes in the boot disc are the key
[2013-01-11 17:15:23] <lulzorz> it's vulnerable to replay attacks and DoS, but it works some of the time
[2013-01-11 17:15:33] <monadicity> but its not clear what way youd knock.. maybe just open and close a telnet connection
[2013-01-11 17:15:44] <lulzorz> you can also send data in ping packets, so someone might try that
[2013-01-11 17:16:19] <Kokosnuss> I can write a quick batch file to do that if anyone wants to try it on windows
[2013-01-11 17:16:45] <iIIustrious> don't have access to windows right now, but I'm working on something anyway
[2013-01-11 17:17:11] <Kokosnuss> Ok. What's the address you'd type in to ping?
[2013-01-11 17:17:12] <lulzorz> monadicity: SYN dest 2, SYN dest 3, SYN dest 5, SYN dest 3, SYN dest 2, telnet 180
[2013-01-11 17:17:15] <lulzorz> or something like that

[2013-01-11 18:11:03] <NikTitanik> i dual boot linux
[2013-01-11 18:11:04] <iIIustrious> I mean, I like gaming too
[2013-01-11 18:11:40] <lulzorz> if you really need them both
[2013-01-11 18:11:51] <lulzorz> then linux uses a hell of a lot less resources
[2013-01-11 18:11:51] <Lurker69> srbsrb i ahve the link somwhere
[2013-01-11 18:11:57] <Lurker69> didnt try hoe it works
[2013-01-11 18:11:59] <lulzorz> so is the logical choice for VM
[2013-01-11 18:12:17] <lulzorz> of course, if you care at all about security, giving windows root on your linux is a totes bad plan
[2013-01-11 18:12:33] <iIIustrious> haha
[2013-01-11 18:12:36] <iIIustrious> yes
[2013-01-11 18:12:40] <Lurker69> http://codeseekah.com/cicada/console.html
[2013-01-11 18:12:43] <lulzorz> root as well as offline root, actually
[2013-01-11 18:12:44] <Lurker69> that should beit
[2013-01-11 18:12:49] <lulzorz> physical access in fact
[2013-01-11 18:13:09] <iIIustrious> I just stick to having both options. But if I'm doing anything notable, it'll be in linux
[2013-01-11 18:13:21] <lulzorz> wine does it for me
[2013-01-11 18:13:41] <iIIustrious> being in compsci, I get free legit versions of all the ult and office microsoft stuff
[2013-01-11 18:13:43] <lulzorz> when I want to play with cmd and feel the brain damage
[2013-01-11 18:13:50] <lulzorz> it's like sniffing markers except with shells
[2013-01-11 18:13:51] <Lurker69> http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/TELNET_ONION_OUTPUTS liknk is in wiki also
[2013-01-11 18:14:33] <lulzorz> the difference is that I can teach myself everything I'll ever need to know for $0 without joining some sort of system
[2013-01-11 18:15:02] <lulzorz> and I'm not going to have to magically start paying when I graduate
[2013-01-11 18:15:21] <lulzorz> aaand I can take the whole thing apart to see how it works
[2013-01-11 18:15:25] <lulzorz> and rebuild it the way I want
[2013-01-11 18:15:31] <lulzorz> there's really no contest here...
[2013-01-11 18:15:54] <iIIustrious> I don't think there ever was, but that it's good to have both
[2013-01-11 18:16:18] <iIIustrious> linux is the obvious best option, but that's irrelevant to whether you should have options
[2013-01-11 18:16:52] <Lurker69> not going to have to magically start being payed when I graduate...   ....so all that go to school shit parents told me is A LIE?
[2013-01-11 18:17:07] <Lurker69> what about SDANTa?
[2013-01-11 18:17:10] <lulzorz> I'm not paying $$$ to keep a bad option open, but that's my opinion
[2013-01-11 18:17:26] <Lurker69> i also didng  finish my degree
[2013-01-11 18:17:34] <Lurker69> dont se any point in it
[2013-01-11 18:17:37] <iIIustrious> haha, if I didn't get it for free, I'd use a cracked version, I'm also not paying to keep them open
[2013-01-11 18:17:43] <iIIustrious> that's when it gets stupid
[2013-01-11 18:17:47] <Lurker69> besides i am in differend field now
[2013-01-11 18:17:51] <Oversight> Half way to my Ph.D
[2013-01-11 18:18:03] <lulzorz> now that I can agree with...except that they could sue you if they wanted
[2013-01-11 18:18:14] <iIIustrious> yeah, I'm going to finish mine mostly because a lot of the cool research is going on at grad schools
[2013-01-11 18:18:44] <iIIustrious> they could, but they'd have to find an individual user in a different country
[2013-01-11 18:18:51] <iIIustrious> that's pretty unlikely
[2013-01-11 18:20:11] <lulzorz> yeah
[2013-01-11 18:20:23] <lulzorz> but if somebody needed something to pin on you...
[2013-01-11 18:20:32] <iIIustrious> then it's an easy one, it's true

[2013-01-11 18:24:10] <Lurker69> then started to design  posters and flyers... switched to web desing...  no there is no point in finishind my industrial design college, since all the #D ind design is done in china today, no real jobs for Catia here atm 
[2013-01-11 18:24:29] <lulzorz> we've got nothing to work with...this is a puzzle without clues
[2013-01-11 18:24:51] <iIIustrious> no clues, just data
[2013-01-11 18:24:53] <Lurker69> we heve some loose ends
[2013-01-11 18:24:56] <indigo_|School> iIIustrious : I assume we did a port scan, anything with that?
[2013-01-11 18:25:12] <iIIustrious> as far as I've heard, there's only one port open, and it's never responded
[2013-01-11 18:25:14] <iIIustrious> 80
[2013-01-11 18:25:15] <indigo_|School> Lurker69 : Any chance the wiki has those

[2013-01-11 18:25:49] <iIIustrious> soul was doing a full scan, haven't heard anything positive, bakpak did the first few hundred ports with no luck
[2013-01-11 18:26:11] <Lurker69> http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/TOR_2_ver_2_back_ONLINE hear is what i know about tor2
[2013-01-11 18:26:27] <indigo_|School> So nothing concrete from onion 2, just Welcome Home = 11 letters, and maybe only being up on prime days
[2013-01-11 18:26:33] <iIIustrious> we also ran the first thousand primes as url/*.jpg , .html .png and .txt
[2013-01-11 18:26:51] <Lurker69> indigo_and check the diagram i made, it is not finished yey but you will get the point
[2013-01-11 18:27:31] <indigo_|School> Lurker69 : Which one?

[2013-01-11 18:28:48] <indigo_|School> Lurker69 : I've seen that, I was just curious of leads from onion 2s second run
[2013-01-11 18:29:21] <Lurker69> indigo_|School: only 	http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/TOR_2_ver_2_back_ONLINE 
[2013-01-11 18:29:30] <Lurker69> few differences in selfdoxing
[2013-01-11 18:29:42] <Lurker69> and lots of things we tried and doidnt work
[2013-01-11 18:29:50] <indigo_|School> Lurker69 : I assume this one didn't selfdox itself
[2013-01-11 18:29:56] <Lurker69> it did
[2013-01-11 18:30:12] <Lurker69> but selfdox link is not working on plainweb
[2013-01-11 18:30:17] <lulzorz> which means they didn't take the onion down because dox
[2013-01-11 18:30:24] <Lurker69> uf did we chack selfdoxing link on tor?

[2013-01-11 18:30:51] <indigo_|School> lulzorz : So it was intentional, interseting
[2013-01-11 18:31:01] <Lurker69> so all that selfdoxing info might be spoffed
[2013-01-11 18:31:06] <lulzorz> indigo_|School: that's the implication, yeah

[2013-01-11 18:32:25] <lulzorz> since they appear to be different servers entirely

[2013-01-11 18:37:33] <lulzorz> I've done software versioning before, starting from 0 makes more sense to me

[2013-01-11 18:38:06] <lulzorz> it's weird though...I don't think we should go onion0/onion1.0/onion1.1
[2013-01-11 18:38:10] <Lurker69> so we  have onion1;   onion 2 ver 1/onion2.0; onion 2 ver 2/onion2.1  and next one (new address)will be called onion3

[2013-01-11 18:38:36] <indigo_|School> I think thats a bit cleaner
[2013-01-11 18:38:56] <indigo_|School> lulzorz : But this isn't a beta onion, its a full release :P
[2013-01-11 18:39:06] <Lurker69> Tech1: we are just debating how to call our onions, so we will all know what we a re talking about
[2013-01-11 18:39:10] <soulseekah> why not just call it onion2
[2013-01-11 18:39:15] <soulseekah> the url is the same
[2013-01-11 18:39:16] <lulzorz> Lurker69: I think to reduce confusion and in consideration of it having the same address, I'll agree with you
[2013-01-11 18:39:32] <soulseekah> you can refer to the old one as "the older onion2"
[2013-01-11 18:39:40] <soulseekah> I bet we're not going to even mention it within 24 hours
[2013-01-11 18:39:41] <lulzorz> indigo_|School: I was thinking more along the lines of it being a "thing" instead of a "version"
[2013-01-11 18:39:51] <Tech1> Lurker69: ok
[2013-01-11 18:39:59] <Tech1> i assume we didn't get too much further?
[2013-01-11 18:40:01] <Lurker69> soulseekah: yes but imagine what will happen if we find another onion adress /onion3
[2013-01-11 18:40:03] <lulzorz> soulseekah: that's almost as stupid as "the new ipad", IMO
[2013-01-11 18:40:11] <indigo_|School> lulzorz : you mentioned program versioning, I was trying to relate it to that
[2013-01-11 18:40:26] <indigo_|School> lulzorz : most people won't delve deeper then the tor adress, not many people care about the hostname and server, so I think keeping it less confusing would be better
[2013-01-11 18:40:44] <lulzorz> indigo_|School: yeah, I know...I'm thinking of onions as a "thing", not a "program", so it starts from 1 instead of 0
[2013-01-11 18:40:57] <soulseekah> :D
[2013-01-11 18:41:12] <lulzorz> on the contrary, the server hostname is important, or they wouldn't be giving it to us
[2013-01-11 18:41:25] <Lurker69> damn that zero, why do they had to invent itm, itcauses only problems
[2013-01-11 18:41:37] <soulseekah> 0 is off, 1 is on :)
[2013-01-11 18:41:47] <indigo_|School> lulzorz : I agree, that not only makes more sense, but its less confusing
[2013-01-11 18:41:47] <soulseekah> you need to have an off
[2013-01-11 18:41:56] <lulzorz> Lurker69: well, it started when somebody decided that numbers are pretty well represented as 00000000
[2013-01-11 18:42:19] <Lurker69> if you count from 0 to 10 you have 11 numbers o.O  some poeple will never undestand why that happens
[2013-01-11 18:42:27] <lulzorz> Lurker69: and then somebody wanted to refer to a list of things, so they said, all right, thing one is 00000001
[2013-01-11 18:42:32] <lulzorz> Lurker69: and then somebody else said, but wait, what will we use 00000000 for?
[2013-01-11 18:42:58] <lulzorz> Lurker69: but 10 has two digits, it's a totally different class of number
[2013-01-11 18:43:08] <lulzorz> Lurker69: so they decided to shift everything down one and start from 0
[2013-01-11 18:43:17] <lulzorz> Lurker69: and everyone has been confused all the time ever since then
[2013-01-11 18:43:20] <lulzorz> Lurker69: </storytime>
[2013-01-11 18:43:35] <Lurker69> but my teache told me  to start counting fingers with one...
[2013-01-11 18:44:00] <lulzorz> that's because you count things
[2013-01-11 18:44:03] <lulzorz> not array indices

[2013-01-11 19:33:34] <lulzorz> which is weird, since they used the larger file for twitter.jpg, which was small enough to fit with the smaller file
[2013-01-11 19:33:36] <Lurker69> we used .13 before .00 and there was no way to use them in defferent order

[2013-01-11 20:21:26] <crash_demons> so it would not detect those later text inclusions in JPEG, etc
[2013-01-11 20:22:54] <crash_demons> the only special detection mode it really has is G, GZip Scan  which is a regular scan which checks for a GZIP header
[2013-01-11 20:23:06] <crash_demons> it's slower than regular scans
[2013-01-11 20:23:59] <lulzorz> so 3301.iso was generated Thu Jan 3 23:19:55, according to 0x9800
[2013-01-11 20:24:16] <lulzorz> has the whole isolinux command line in there, too

[2013-01-12 00:34:35] <scrounger> wait, the onion site pings?
[2013-01-12 00:34:40] <Tech1> rough.  no major developments in about 72 hours
[2013-01-12 00:34:41] <Tech1> scrounger: yea man
[2013-01-12 00:34:41] <scrounger> so, we've got:
[2013-01-12 00:34:41] <scrounger> 1) onion 2 goes down.
[2013-01-12 00:34:43] <Tech1> *2.0
[2013-01-12 00:34:45] <scrounger> 2) onion 2 comes up, still doxx's itself

[2013-01-12 00:34:47] <Tech1> ha
[2013-01-12 00:34:49] <anonykush> too bad, it looks like a tough one
[2013-01-12 00:35:03] <scrounger> 3) clear net (port 81) is shut down
[2013-01-12 00:35:08] <scrounger> 4) clearnet still pings though
[2013-01-12 00:35:09] <Tech1> it's fun either way anonykush
[2013-01-12 00:35:34] <Tech1> 2.0 goes down, 2.1 comes up, doxes to linode, still takes clearnet pings
[2013-01-12 00:35:34] <Tech1> yea
[2013-01-12 00:35:34] <anonykush> certainly i have learned a lot from lurking here

[2013-01-12 00:36:05] <scrounger> so, whatever it is has to be somewhere in either 1) apache, or 2) clearnet?
[2013-01-12 00:36:07] <Tech1> i'm 95% sure it's an apache leak
[2013-01-12 00:36:13] <scrounger> clearnet has 0 ports open, but pings.
[2013-01-12 00:36:16] <Tech1> the default 404 page returns the hostname
[2013-01-12 00:37:13] <scrounger> so it's gotta be in there somewhere.
[2013-01-12 00:37:18] <scrounger> anyone notice anything weird?
[2013-01-12 00:37:35] <Tech1> we're pretty sure it's being served by a web framework
[2013-01-12 00:38:03] <Tech1> based on how the html is formatted, but it's still a guess, you can format it like that by hand
[2013-01-12 00:38:23] <Tech1> and there isn't any meta data, which AFAIK a framework would insert by default

[2013-01-12 00:54:28] <Ixateht> random googling...there was mention of the parable being a reference to the golden ratio.  There is some discussion of the golden ratio and primes online.  In fact, they form a sort of spiral pattern.

[2013-01-12 00:55:15] <Ixateht> dyadic also mentioned that 560 is congruent with 1 modulo 13 and -1 modulo 17
[2013-01-12 00:55:37] <Ixateht> led me to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_group_of_integers_modulo_n
[2013-01-12 00:55:53] <Ixateht> which led to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmichael_number
[2013-01-12 00:56:07] <Ixateht> bit over my head on the math
[2013-01-12 00:56:42] <Tech1> ..i know some of these words...
[2013-01-12 00:56:43] <dyadic> the parable to me sounds like a description of an insect molting, which sounded like some metaphor for steganography

[2013-01-12 00:58:36] <Ixateht> i think the thought was the "divinity within" line could refer to the golden ratio aka divinie proportion
[2013-01-12 00:58:56] <dyadic> ahh
[2013-01-12 01:00:35] <Ixateht> this was interesting, but perhaps just a coincidence...
[2013-01-12 01:00:38] <dyadic> I know the golden ratio is related to fibonacci numbers
[2013-01-12 01:00:40] <Ixateht> "561 is a Carmichael number, thus n560 is congruent to 1 modulo 561 for any number n coprime to 561"
[2013-01-12 01:00:54] <Ixateht> that should be "n to the 560"

[2013-01-12 01:03:36] <Tech1> that's right
[2013-01-12 01:03:37] <bakpak2hvy> google calculator says 3301^560 is infinity
[2013-01-12 01:03:41] <bakpak2hvy> just saying
[2013-01-12 01:03:45] <dyadic> the carmichael number thing has got to be it, I don't think it will be xor though
[2013-01-12 01:03:51] <Ixateht> yeah
[2013-01-12 01:04:01] <Tech1> i too think that we have already proved that we can xor
[2013-01-12 01:04:03] <Ixateht> even 13^560 and 17^560 are huge huge numbers
[2013-01-12 01:04:06] <Tech1> at this point in the series
[2013-01-12 01:04:37] <bakpak2hvy> 13^560 is also infinity, apparently
[2013-01-12 01:04:42] <bakpak2hvy> not even gonna bother with 17
[2013-01-12 01:04:46] <Tech1> try wolfram alpha?
[2013-01-12 01:04:49] <dyadic> I think given that 561 is carmichael, it probalby is modular arithmetic
[2013-01-12 01:05:02] <Ixateht> 43*13 = 559 and 33*17 = 561 for their congruence to 560

[2013-01-12 01:05:38] <Ixateht> and for golden ratio relatedness phi^13 = 521 which is prime
[2013-01-12 01:05:46] <Ixateht> and phi^17 = 3571 which is prime

[2013-01-12 01:10:16] <dyadic> since 17 and 561 are coprime too

[2013-01-12 01:19:12] <lulzorz> language is important too, I suppose...but numbers really did the trick

[2013-01-12 01:20:31] <sbrsbr> i know numbers are important, but just that without language as a system, numbers are nothing.
[2013-01-12 01:20:34] <Aloo> I like to think I'm a good writer. Moderately heavy vocabulary. Never do get the time in to mature the style though.
[2013-01-12 01:21:22] <lulzorz> the technical language that goes with math is important

[2013-01-12 01:22:41] <Aloo> Can you guys do something with the binary of a number?
[2013-01-12 01:22:43] <Aloo> is it useful?
[2013-01-12 01:23:02] <lulzorz> shift to the left to multiply by two, shift right to divide
[2013-01-12 01:23:14] <lulzorz> you can add and everything, whatever you want
[2013-01-12 01:23:34] <Aloo> wat?
[2013-01-12 01:23:37] <lulzorz> works just like base 1010 except only 10 digits
[2013-01-12 01:23:50] <Aloo> for this task I mean
[2013-01-12 01:24:02] <lulzorz> whole thing so far has been based on xor
[2013-01-12 01:24:05] <lulzorz> which is binary
[2013-01-12 01:24:14] <lulzorz> oh, and outguess
[2013-01-12 01:24:19] <lulzorz> which is pure bit-twiddling
[2013-01-12 01:24:29] <Aloo> How about the binary of 56017 and 56013
[2013-01-12 01:24:41] <Aloo> http://numdic.com/56013
[2013-01-12 01:24:43] <Aloo> http://numdic.com/56017
[2013-01-12 01:24:46] <Aloo> http://numdic.com/560
[2013-01-12 01:25:17] <lulzorz> it's 3 bits difference
[2013-01-12 01:25:29] <lulzorz> xor is 11100
[2013-01-12 01:25:55] <lulzorz> 28, I believe
[2013-01-12 01:26:06] <lulzorz> no, doesn't really mean anything, sorry

[2013-01-12 01:50:52] <lulzorz> 1 BTC says it won't change and we're missing something major
[2013-01-12 01:51:08] <Aloo> I just downloaded putty, How do I get on to the onion that turned back on?
[2013-01-12 01:51:22] <Tech1> 1 sec, wallet updating
[2013-01-12 01:51:43] <Aloo> guise
[2013-01-12 01:51:55] <funride> you have to use the telnet option and add the appropriate tor socks proxy info
[2013-01-12 01:51:57] <sbrsbr> Aloo this is the link http://xsxnaksict6egxkq.onion
[2013-01-12 01:52:20] <lulzorz> heh, I think mine is like 45 days behind

[2013-01-12 01:52:33] <Tech1> how bout .5 lulzorz? that's only a few days mining
[2013-01-12 01:52:34] <lulzorz> Aloo: 80
[2013-01-12 01:52:36] <funride> tor is generally on 9050
[2013-01-12 01:52:45] <funride> the telnet server on 80

[2013-01-12 01:53:39] <Aloo> I put web adress as the host name
[2013-01-12 01:53:42] <Aloo> right?
[2013-01-12 01:53:47] <lulzorz> Aloo: yeah
[2013-01-12 01:54:04] <funride> port 80
[2013-01-12 01:54:10] <funride> conn. type telnet
[2013-01-12 01:54:15] <bakpak2hvy> lulzorz: pm's, if nobody reads them im going to fucking die
[2013-01-12 01:54:33] <Aloo> unable to open connection to http. host does not exist
[2013-01-12 01:54:38] <funride> then under connection->proxy choose socks5
[2013-01-12 01:54:55] <funride> and enter 127.0.0.1 and 9050
[2013-01-12 01:55:08] <funride> also dns lookup at proxy end yes
[2013-01-12 01:55:40] <Aloo> keep port 80 or 9050 now?
[2013-01-12 01:55:41] <funride> try the first onion so you know your connection is setup correctly
[2013-01-12 01:55:51] <funride> under proxy it's 9050
[2013-01-12 01:56:03] <Aloo> still telnet?
[2013-01-12 01:56:11] <funride> no, socks5
[2013-01-12 01:56:19] <Aloo> connection type I mean
[2013-01-12 01:56:28] <funride> yes
[2013-01-12 01:56:48] <Aloo> Oh, I enter everything in proxy?
[2013-01-12 01:57:19] <funride> no, under proxy you setup the connection to tor
[2013-01-12 01:57:39] <funride> under session you setup what you actually want to do
[2013-01-12 01:57:52] <Aloo> alright, When I enter everything in proxy, I go to session and enter the web adress - 9050?
[2013-01-12 01:58:05] <funride> onion address and 80
[2013-01-12 01:58:17] <Aloo> conn type?

[2013-01-12 02:29:08] <funride> why is that
[2013-01-12 02:29:24] <Lurker69> + means number is prime

[2013-01-12 02:30:24] <funride> for "count ia" it returns "107*"
[2013-01-12 02:31:17] <sbrsbr> count cicada returns 340
[2013-01-12 02:32:16] <bakpak2hvy> count patience is a virtue returns 761, IIRC
[2013-01-12 02:32:34] <Tech1> sure does
[2013-01-12 02:32:38] <bakpak2hvy> which is prime, fo shizzle
[2013-01-12 02:33:02] <sbrsbr> isnt 761 also lenght of the song backwards?
[2013-01-12 02:33:15] <bakpak2hvy> dont ask me
[2013-01-12 02:33:22] <Tech1> 761 was the title of the song??
[2013-01-12 02:33:24] <Tech1> it was
[2013-01-12 02:33:30] <Tech1> 761 was the title of the song
[2013-01-12 02:33:37] <bakpak2hvy> thats right, the title
[2013-01-12 02:33:39] <sbrsbr> oh ok
[2013-01-12 02:33:43] <Tech1> wait
[2013-01-12 02:33:47] <Tech1> did we make that connection before?
[2013-01-12 02:34:02] <sbrsbr> which one?
[2013-01-12 02:34:04] <bakpak2hvy> dont think so, but idk
[2013-01-12 02:34:19] <Tech1> count patience is a virtue == same as the title of a song
[2013-01-12 02:34:27] <Tech1> that quite a few people think may have more info
[2013-01-12 02:34:40] <Tech1> maybe it's just by chance.
[2013-01-12 02:35:02] <sbrsbr> maybe, maybe not like with everything here lol
[2013-01-12 02:35:10] <Tech1> yeah, good point
[2013-01-12 02:35:32] <sbrsbr> btw do we have author of the song? or is it implyied its cicada OC?
[2013-01-12 02:35:39] <Tech1> author was 3301
[2013-01-12 02:35:51] <Tech1> if you opened it in VLC, it pulled an image from cicada 2013
[2013-01-12 02:35:53] <Tech1> *2012

[2013-01-12 02:47:17] <fuszface> they really do want the most intelligent people
[2013-01-12 02:47:22] <dyadic> eisenstein primes are just a set of primes in a different number system

[2013-01-12 02:47:27] <dyadic> ah
[2013-01-12 02:47:47] <dyadic> don't worry about that then, they are university abstract algebra topics

[2013-01-12 02:53:57] <sbrsbr> i think we might be looking too much for small details. From what i've read last year's game wasn't as hard as this one. And it was also focused on some more historic stuff (caesar cypher, king arthur, holy grial) I might be talking shit, because i didn't do last year's

[2013-01-12 02:55:33] <sbrsbr> we dont know what to work on
[2013-01-12 02:55:38] <dyadic> anybody else tried compressing the data files?
[2013-01-12 02:56:02] <bakpak2hvy> i think the "the answer is all around you" or whatever it was could help us if we can figure what the fuck it means
[2013-01-12 02:56:36] <sbrsbr> yeah im pretty sure that's some kind of clue we must use
[2013-01-12 02:57:34] <sbrsbr> also, when i saw "patience is a virtue" i thought of Psychomachia, but I havent found anything else tying that to cicada
[2013-01-12 02:58:02] <dyadic> these data files are either noise, or all ready compressed...
[2013-01-12 02:58:28] <sbrsbr> you mean 560.00/13/17?
[2013-01-12 02:58:57] <dyadic> yeah
[2013-01-12 02:59:27] <bakpak2hvy> this is not very relevant, but are we still the only group working on this?
[2013-01-12 02:59:56] <dyadic> probably way behind

[2013-01-12 04:17:02] <anon413X> something like in a clock form

[2013-01-12 05:02:12] <Cooper5> There has to be something else we can do to that onion...
[2013-01-12 05:02:14] <fuszface> well if you don't solve the puzzles you'll never know anything about cicada or whether or not it's a troll
[2013-01-12 05:02:20] <fuszface> unless of course a member leaks information
[2013-01-12 05:02:47] <fuszface> they only want a few individuals and only a few individuals, if any at all, are able to qualify
[2013-01-12 05:03:09] <Cooper5> But we're still in the co-operative stages of the game.
[2013-01-12 05:03:16] <Cooper5> They haven't split us yet.
[2013-01-12 05:03:47] <fuszface> ya but what I'm saying is after it's all said and done only a few individuals will have made it
[2013-01-12 05:03:54] <fuszface> and the others will never know anything about it
[2013-01-12 05:06:06] <fuszface> my theory on cicada is that it's merely an idea to get anon's fluent in encrypting information so if total censorship and moderation does occur it can be combated
[2013-01-12 05:06:07] <Lurker69> damn working on that diagram a bit and PS is doing serious strike
[2013-01-12 05:06:35] <Lurker69> PS doent want same  10 000px  size image to be open few days in a row
[2013-01-12 05:07:32] <anonykush> I agree with fuszface this whole operations feels like a training of sorts
[2013-01-12 05:07:39] <Lurker69> Cooper5: they will newer split us
[2013-01-12 05:08:11] <anonykush> but if thats the case.  Who will go at such lenghts to teach curious minds how to hack/
[2013-01-12 05:08:13] <Lurker69> only we are the one who can split ourselves
[2013-01-12 05:08:48] <Cooper5> Kinda hard to use proper encryption when all we've been doing to "decrypt" files is putting it through tools available on the net and XORing shit together.
[2013-01-12 05:08:57] <Lurker69> even when we get individual tasks  (if we will get them) we  have to work togather, not man if any can solve them alone
[2013-01-12 05:09:33] <anonykush> perhaps there is another technique that needs to be applied.  Look in your toolkit
[2013-01-12 05:09:34] <Lurker69> we will still get same tasks only input data will be different, al least it was that way last year
[2013-01-12 05:09:35] <Cooper5> Sure we've seen a lot of really intelligent people show up over the course of this, and they did things I couldn't do, but so far it has been relatively straightforward.
[2013-01-12 05:09:45] <Kokosnuss> fuszface, that is an interesting theory I haven't thought of
[2013-01-12 05:10:08] <Cooper5> I've always thought of Cicada as an online form of the Masons.
[2013-01-12 05:10:29] <Lurker69> i am telling people to try other logical operations beside yor   AND | OR | XOR | NOT | NAND | NOR | XNOR
[2013-01-12 05:10:33] <Cooper5> Working behind the scenes to benefit the many.
[2013-01-12 05:10:35] <anonykush> maybe the Masonic Hackers are doing this
[2013-01-12 05:10:53] <anonykush> surely they most have a wed presence
[2013-01-12 05:10:54] <Lurker69> i cand do that i am not coder, it would take days for me to put togather code that would dod that
[2013-01-12 05:11:01] <anonykush> web
[2013-01-12 05:11:29] <anonykush> last year one of the people had to write scripts to get to the next level
[2013-01-12 05:11:33] <Lurker69> i suspect for long time that Masons or Illuminati dont exist at all
[2013-01-12 05:11:34] <Kokosnuss> Yea, what lurker said. At best, I write batch files to annoy people
[2013-01-12 05:12:49] <Lurker69> it is just like anonymous, no real group, just a buncs odf different groups for diffferent ops all they have in vcommon is use of same name
[2013-01-12 05:12:50] <anonykush> no, they are real but they are with the rich and powerful.  Us mere mortals dont have the privilige to rub shoulders with them
[2013-01-12 05:12:50] <absolutezeroff> AND
[2013-01-12 05:12:50] <anonykush> Washington was a Mason and a lot of the founding fathers were too
[2013-01-12 05:12:52] <absolutezeroff> i think i can code something that can do any of those to be honest
[2013-01-12 05:13:31] <fasd> my grandfather is a mason, they do nothing
[2013-01-12 05:13:41] <fuszface> owned
[2013-01-12 05:13:45] <anonykush> anonymous is different...but the loose coordination is doing harm to the group plus there are a lot of snitches out there
[2013-01-12 05:14:01] <Lurker69> you have all the scripts in #3301hackers
[2013-01-12 05:14:06] <Lurker69> in the pad
[2013-01-12 05:14:23] <fasd> they use to do stuff but now they are just a bunch of old people who only invite kin to join
[2013-01-12 05:14:28] <anonykush> crowley was a mason?
[2013-01-12 05:15:25] <anonykush> the rich and powerful know a lot of shit and we will never know it unless a brave anon hacks a server and get us some precious info
[2013-01-12 05:15:38] <Lurker69> loose of coordination is bad and good, bad because of ineffitienc and no common goal, and good because it is imposible for police to sniff the leaders because there arent any, and if then do lock some important member there are many new guys behind him
[2013-01-12 05:16:18] <Lurker69> anonykush: we can ge that brave anons
[2013-01-12 05:16:30] <anonykush> but anonymous is getting infiltrated by pigs due to this loose coordination where there is no allegiance to nothing
[2013-01-12 05:17:25] <anonykush> a hacker is a loner by nature i guess
[2013-01-12 05:18:30] <Lurker69> yes anonops id ful of feds, but  clever guys know what they are doing, there  is alot  of things happening all the time, most os can be  finidhed if there is big enough interest among people, pigs cant do much to stop them

[2013-01-12 05:27:29] <fasd> has the number 501 come up at all?
[2013-01-12 05:27:51] <Grazza> i think i heard it before
[2013-01-12 05:27:54] <Grazza> but its not prime
[2013-01-12 05:27:59] <Grazza> so i dont think its useful

[2013-01-12 05:32:17] <Lurker69> maybe we will get any text in runes later, but it would be lame cipher , bit to easy, unles we get  long ass text in runes and we will have to make OCR for it
[2013-01-12 05:34:08] <absolutezeroff> 501
[2013-01-12 05:34:11] <absolutezeroff> isn't one of the data files 501
[2013-01-12 05:34:34] <anonykush> so whats the best lead we got so far
[2013-01-12 05:37:36] <Lurker69> tor2 ,telnet on tor 1
[2013-01-12 05:38:08] <Lurker69> also pareable poem from mp3 wasnt used anywhere yet
[2013-01-12 05:38:08] <anonykush> any theories on the 7's and +'s on tor1
[2013-01-12 05:38:39] <fasd> if 501 is a file name xor it with Welcome back.
[2013-01-12 05:38:41] <anonykush> freaking parable number i dont understand it.  It must be meant to be broken down somehow
[2013-01-12 05:38:41] <Lurker69> just random chosse of asci art generator
[2013-01-12 05:39:01] <Lurker69> parable broken t ofactors is
[2013-01-12 05:39:09] <anonykush> tok so the 7's and +'s are random
[2013-01-12 05:39:17] <Lurker69> 1595 277641 = 1031 x 1229 x 1259 
[2013-01-12 05:39:32] <Lurker69> all three factors are EMIRPS
[2013-01-12 05:39:34] <dyadic> absolutezeroff: yeah, iirc read() returns a string, not integer
[2013-01-12 05:39:44] <anonykush> the question is what kind of parable. a parable of crowley seems likely
[2013-01-12 05:39:48] <dyadic> you need to convert to ordinals and such first
[2013-01-12 05:39:48] <Lurker69> meanin tha tare primes in direction back front also
[2013-01-12 05:41:00] <anonykush> wisdom and folly.  What is the significance.  I know its a work by crowley
[2013-01-12 05:41:29] <absolutezeroff> oh
[2013-01-12 05:41:36] <absolutezeroff> hm
[2013-01-12 05:41:53] <absolutezeroff> so i convert the binary into a long integer

[2013-01-12 05:48:44] <dyadic> something like that
[2013-01-12 05:49:08] <dyadic> I tried to keep it readable and the style you were writing it
[2013-01-12 05:49:31] <dyadic> but you have to change strings to lists of integers, then perform the bitwise operations on each pair of integers
[2013-01-12 05:52:41] <dyadic> absolutezeroff: yeah it's kind of odd...when you read/write with 'b', python uses the string type for it
[2013-01-12 05:53:19] <dyadic> I guess not that odd but looks odd

[2013-01-12 06:13:13] <bak|tpt> and again around 5:30 that afternoon
[2013-01-12 06:13:27] <bak|tpt> and go to bed for real at 6:30 tonight
[2013-01-12 06:13:28] <Kokosnuss> I'd shower first then sleep unless you have to look nice for this important place

[2013-01-12 06:19:04] <dyadic> ah
[2013-01-12 06:19:17] <Kokosnuss> If you take the number from it, "1,595,277,641" and google it, you don't get any results

[2013-01-12 06:28:25] <dyadic> you mean, of other numbers?

[2013-01-12 06:33:59] <Kokosnuss> I just thought it interesting that so much of this is USA based

[2013-01-12 06:34:52] <Aloo> NA
[2013-01-12 06:35:00] <Kokosnuss> Especially with the Cicada papers showing up on houses in foreign countries. Shows how extensive this all is
[2013-01-12 06:35:01] <n_factor> ntsc is actually an obsolete format
[2013-01-12 06:35:02] <n_factor> it

[2013-01-12 06:53:22] <n_factor> the golden ratio is represented by phi, not pi

[2013-01-12 06:55:11] <crash_demons> why are primes related to pi?
[2013-01-12 06:55:55] <crash_demons> I think this has been explained to me before in a classroom, but I don't recall why
[2013-01-12 06:56:05] <nadando> the prime counting function, pi(x)
[2013-01-12 06:56:40] <rr645> Hmm...pi(3301)? 464, not very interesting
[2013-01-12 06:56:43] <crash_demons> I understand that that exists

[2013-01-12 06:57:20] <rr645> crash: pi(x) is the number of primes equal to or less than x
[2013-01-12 06:58:34] <crash_demons> stop telling me the definition
[2013-01-12 06:58:46] <crash_demons> I meant, why is it called what it is.
[2013-01-12 06:59:36] * crash_demons fully expects someone to answer "it's called the pi function"
[2013-01-12 06:59:42] <n_factor> We had to use Euler functions last year when breaking RSA keys.
[2013-01-12 06:59:48] <rr645> Oh, sorry. I was taught that pi being the greek letter 'P' was selected to stand for 'primes'
[2013-01-12 06:59:50] <n_factor> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_totient_function
[2013-01-12 06:59:53] <n_factor> that's his phi function
[2013-01-12 06:59:59] <n_factor> primes
[2013-01-12 07:00:03] <dyadic> crash_demons: you mean why is that function called pi?
[2013-01-12 07:00:04] <n_factor> making phi primes
[2013-01-12 07:00:06] <crash_demons> rr645, ok.
[2013-01-12 07:00:26] <crash_demons> dyadic, yeah, but I guess rr645's explanation works.
[2013-01-12 07:00:44] <dyadic> there aren't enough unique latin, greek, hebrew letters for all significant things to have unique names
[2013-01-12 07:00:57] <dyadic> so they get reused depending on context
[2013-01-12 07:01:43] <Aloo> effectively, all the primes are in the decimal expansion of pi
[2013-01-12 07:01:58] <crash_demons> Aloo, can you prove that?
[2013-01-12 07:02:25] <Aloo> Major math theory is reliant on the decimal expansion pi being infinite.
[2013-01-12 07:02:31] <nadando> would that depend if pi was normal
[2013-01-12 07:02:43] <nadando> whic isn't proved
[2013-01-12 07:03:02] <Aloo> If there are infinite numbers, There is an infinite order sets of numbers
[2013-01-12 07:03:13] <Aloo> But Pi is a fantastic too
[2013-01-12 07:03:31] <Aloo> its really flexible and theres a good posibility we might need to use it
[2013-01-12 07:03:39] <crash_demons> whether pi is actually random is still up for debate, afaik.
[2013-01-12 07:03:48] <n_factor> The security of an RSA system would be compromised if the number n could be factored or if φ(n) could be computed without factoring n.
[2013-01-12 07:03:49] <n_factor> guys
[2013-01-12 07:03:54] <Lurker69> pi code? i was reading about that once
[2013-01-12 07:04:09] <Aloo> What N_?
[2013-01-12 07:04:14] <n_factor> that's euler's phi function, which uses the golden ratio.
[2013-01-12 07:04:19] <Aloo> Lurker, explain?
[2013-01-12 07:04:21] <n_factor> phi(n)
[2013-01-12 07:04:47] <n_factor> last year we broke RSA by factoring n
[2013-01-12 07:04:56] <n_factor> maybe this year we need to calculate phi(n)
[2013-01-12 07:05:04] <n_factor> with n being the parable #
[2013-01-12 07:05:41] <n_factor> i've tied the parable directly to breaking RSA
[2013-01-12 07:05:47] <crash_demons> can you relate "phi" to "circumference" though?
[2013-01-12 07:05:55] <n_factor> yes
[2013-01-12 07:05:59] <nadando> phi(1595277641) = 1591168720

[2013-01-12 07:06:26] <Aloo> I haven't come across this function

[2013-01-12 07:16:34] <crash_demons> pi compression only works if the position value can be represented in a smaller length than the represented value.  assuming you are testing very long strings then, you will be waiting a long time to compress things.

[2013-01-12 07:42:56] <crash_demons> insignificant though

[2013-01-12 09:56:20] <bakpak2hvy> if you know about onion2, then nothing
[2013-01-12 09:56:56] <n_factor> i think the tree/forest hint is telling us we need to look at every clue together and not at them individually
[2013-01-12 09:57:03] <n_factor> that everything is involved in the solution
[2013-01-12 09:57:24] <n_factor> we're gonna need to tie everything together to see it
[2013-01-12 09:57:57] <bakpak2hvy> makes sense to me

[2013-01-12 09:59:16] <bakpak2hvy> wtf do we do now
[2013-01-12 10:05:34] <n_factor> oh well
[2013-01-12 10:05:43] <n_factor> start figuring out what the poem means
[2013-01-12 10:05:54] <n_factor> they don't do that shit for nothing
[2013-01-12 10:06:16] <n_factor> its usually some historical work of art or a book or something
[2013-01-12 10:06:24] <n_factor> if i know 3301
[2013-01-12 10:06:37] <n_factor> they like to reference historical stuff with poems
[2013-01-12 10:07:43] <n_factor> clues like that usually lead to books or mathematical concepts related to the symbology of the poem
[2013-01-12 10:08:27] <n_factor> something we can work from.
[2013-01-12 10:08:56] <n_factor> it says circumfrences
[2013-01-12 10:09:08] <bakpak2hvy> i know this is irrelevant
[2013-01-12 10:09:13] <n_factor> is it?
[2013-01-12 10:09:13] <bakpak2hvy> but do you know how to cook hashbrowns?
[2013-01-12 10:09:17] <n_factor> yes
[2013-01-12 10:09:24] <bakpak2hvy> how in the hell, i dont even...
[2013-01-12 10:09:38] <n_factor> shred potatoes
[2013-01-12 10:09:58] <n_factor> heat your oil in a frying pan until it's hot enough that a drop of water sizzles in the pan
[2013-01-12 10:10:06] <n_factor> you dont need alot
[2013-01-12 10:10:28] <n_factor> you can either press the shreds into a cake and drop it in the pan
[2013-01-12 10:10:33] <n_factor> or just drop them in
[2013-01-12 10:10:42] <n_factor> flip them over when they start to brown
[2013-01-12 10:10:56] <n_factor> or stir them if you are making more of a hash than a cake
[2013-01-12 10:11:09] <n_factor> when golden brown remove and salt to taste
[2013-01-12 10:11:28] <bakpak2hvy> alright, thanks

[2013-01-12 10:11:40] <n_factor> its fine
[2013-01-12 10:11:46] <n_factor> if the oil starts to smoke its too hot
[2013-01-12 10:11:51] <n_factor> take it off the heat until it cools
[2013-01-12 10:11:57] <n_factor> and turn your heat down
[2013-01-12 10:12:26] <bakpak2hvy> dont know why, but i lol'd
[2013-01-12 10:12:27] <n_factor> keep a lid handy to help minimize splatter and to have in case it does start fire
[2013-01-12 10:12:33] <n_factor> deprive it of o2
[2013-01-12 10:12:54] <n_factor> smoking oil can instanteously combust if its hot enough
[2013-01-12 10:13:25] <n_factor> DO NOT THROW WATER ON THE FIRE

[2013-01-12 10:14:03] <n_factor> water will just boil and is less dense than oil, causing it to explode and throw fire and oil and shit everywhere
[2013-01-12 10:14:03] <bakpak2hvy> SHIT

[2013-01-12 10:17:57] <bakpak2hvy> and i poured some water over the bottom of it after the whole fire thing
[2013-01-12 10:18:00] <bakpak2hvy> its all safe and shit

[2013-01-12 10:18:09] <bakpak2hvy> what do?
[2013-01-12 10:21:13] <n_factor> how much water?
[2013-01-12 10:22:04] <n_factor> wipe it out and put some fresh oil in the pan

[2013-01-12 15:23:26] <Tech1> Not much. Apparently demons found a hash
[2013-01-12 15:24:07] <Tech1> i think checking hash against the files we have may be a decent idea
[2013-01-12 15:24:07] <Cosmo_> Sweet, what are you saying demons?
[2013-01-12 15:24:15] <Cosmo_> Oh he's not here.
[2013-01-12 15:24:20] <Tech1> indeed
[2013-01-12 15:25:15] <Cosmo_> Yeah that sounds like a plan. I found ANOTHER thing to do to the mp3 to try and find a message. Though i'm not holding out much hope.
[2013-01-12 15:26:17] <Tech1> oh, there was another theory with the numbers 761 being relevant to 560 and 13 / 17

[2013-01-12 15:28:52] <Lurker69> here is his theory, it hold some water, but hard to get anything useful out of it
[2013-01-12 15:29:14] <Lurker69> and about that hash, i still think it is completely unrelated
[2013-01-12 15:29:35] <Lurker69> http://images.4chan.org/x/src/1357843764943.jpg it was /x/ thread with no mention of 3301

[2013-01-12 15:30:18] <Lurker69> only thing similar is that that hash is pasted on the bottom of the file in siimilar fashaon ceaesar cipher was i cicada image last year

[2013-01-12 15:37:28] <Lurker69> did people discover that hash at all?

[2013-01-12 15:37:53] <Lurker69> and no PGP
[2013-01-12 15:38:10] <Tech1-Phone> its probably just a troll who just discovered how to hex edit
[2013-01-12 15:38:40] <Lurker69> funny that there isnt much interest for cicada but trolls are doing their job anyway... 
[2013-01-12 15:38:45] <Cosmo_> Euler's is actually so much easier to understand than it used to be. But I don't know how useful it'll be without a scale....
[2013-01-12 15:39:03] <Lurker69> he prbably didnt find that trick at cicad ta all, odr did he?
[2013-01-12 15:40:49] <Cosmo_> Is it sad that during pre-drinks last night a bunch of us were talking about cicada?
[2013-01-12 15:40:52] <Lurker69> well conestion betreen euler and cicada is in "The totient function also plays a key role in the definition of the RSA encryption system."
[2013-01-12 15:41:52] <Cosmo_> Not just that, the divine ratio seems to be hinted at in the parable, and euler's connects to that and to prime numbers
[2013-01-12 15:41:56] <Lurker69> uh i ubnderstand euoler now, i didnt know what gcd means
[2013-01-12 15:42:31] <Lurker69> euler is basically count of numers below n that arent divisor of n
[2013-01-12 15:42:37] <Cosmo_> Also it's connection to the forier transform.....awwww.....shit
[2013-01-12 15:43:41] <Ymgve> Lurker69: lots of people discovered it, and lots of people were stupid about it
[2013-01-12 15:44:23] <Lurker69> didnt know what is realtive prime either, we dont have that term in our language i think, btw wiki math articles  is damn hard to understand if you didnt leaarn math in school in englih
[2013-01-12 15:44:32] <Cosmo_> I don't know how up to date on your sound design you are but a fourier transform is a key way to transfer analogue music into data. This could actually be more apt than i thought.
[2013-01-12 15:45:18] <Lurker69>  fourier transform  is one of the most usefull things in math, that is used in amny many fields
[2013-01-12 15:45:29] <Lurker69> sort of like navier stokes equations
[2013-01-12 15:46:00] <Cosmo_> http://www.relisoft.com/science/physics/sound.html
[2013-01-12 15:47:25] <Cosmo_> This is a basic form of the stuff I've been doing at uni. I have a programme that is literally a 'transform machine', avoiding FFT's i can probably pick apart the mp3 more.

[2013-01-12 19:01:23] <Lurker69> on large events they always have some king of marker
[2013-01-12 19:01:37] <Lurker69> lots of time it is something in their back pocket

[2013-01-12 19:02:01] <Lurker69> 	http://prntscr.com/oxxjt this IS NOT A COP but undercover security on festivals, see the difference, sops will never look you at the eyes, security gusys are not pigs, they still have have a bit of humanity in them
[2013-01-12 19:02:42] <Lurker69> aslo always look at the shoes, their clothes usually match the festivsal (rock rave metal..) but shoes are always wrong

[2013-01-12 19:03:15] <Lurker69> the easiest way to identify them is having big ass DSLR with big lens

[2013-01-12 19:03:44] <Lurker69> not hard to imagine why

[2013-01-12 19:41:22] <Lurker69> as i already said if you are making scripts, try other logical binnary operations  AND | OR | XOR | NOT | NAND | NOR | XNOR
[2013-01-12 19:41:42] <Lurker69> also it is not on the DiAGRAM
[2013-01-12 19:41:49] <Lurker69> .png file is actually loose end
[2013-01-12 19:42:00] <Tech1> which png?
[2013-01-12 19:42:06] <Lurker69> we  used xor to create it  but we didnt get anything out of it
[2013-01-12 19:42:06] <Tech1> the solid black one?
[2013-01-12 19:42:13] <Lurker69> yes almost solid one

[2013-01-12 19:43:36] <Tech1> is it on the wiki?
[2013-01-12 19:43:40] <Lurker69> only thing i got out of it is that i proved  (90%) that that image waas used on twitter account, i wasnt able to create exact came profile picture , but i can if i try hard... but no time right now
[2013-01-12 19:44:13] <Lurker69> http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/Tweeter,_XORing,_Gematria_Primus_and_two_TOR_adresses here it is

[2013-01-12 19:44:49] <Tech1> pushed a few changes, things ran together on the wiki, a few links
[2013-01-12 19:44:52] <Lurker69> not sure if imgur changes pngs when you upload them
[2013-01-12 19:44:55] <soulseekah> u sure we never got anything out of it?
[2013-01-12 19:45:15] <Lurker69> ingur change jpgs  (it deletes metadata) but outguess stay intact
[2013-01-12 19:45:34] <Lurker69> soulseekah: do you remember that png lead to something?
[2013-01-12 19:46:25] <soulseekah> where was onion1 address gotten from? runes.jpg?
[2013-01-12 19:46:39] <Tech1> yeah, i think soul

[2013-01-12 19:47:34] <Lurker69> clue
[2013-01-12 19:47:39] <soulseekah> I love the "loose ends" pics
[2013-01-12 19:47:43] <Lurker69> last year there aws a clue
[2013-01-12 19:48:25] <Tech1> .13 is unused right?
[2013-01-12 19:48:30] <Lurker69> http://www.clevcode.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/duck.jpg  this was lue to use outguess : "guess"  "out"
[2013-01-12 19:48:42] <Lurker69> Tech1:  it hink .17 is unused
[2013-01-12 19:48:49] <cain1595> can be extracted any info from the twitter profile picture?
[2013-01-12 19:49:12] <Lurker69> cain1595: i think not
[2013-01-12 19:49:34] <Lurker69> when you upload profile picture to twitter is is resitzed and resampled by twitter engine
[2013-01-12 19:49:44] <Lurker69> i was experimenting  with it
[2013-01-12 19:50:23] <Lurker69> if you upload .png on twitter it creates almost the same pnd as one on cicada profile, cicada one is just one pixel higher
[2013-01-12 19:50:44] <Lurker69> i cant move my profile pic only for one pixel in twitter editor
[2013-01-12 19:51:27] <Lurker69> if i make new png in PS with right location of cicada png is completely different and twitter make different png (in hex, visdually it is the same)

[2013-01-12 20:49:35] <Lurker69> cant be hals fex color, but thta procentages at channels might be more accurate that  16 bit colordepth allowa, you are right

[2013-01-12 21:14:39] <Tech1> which file did you guys think you saw compression on?
[2013-01-12 21:14:42] <Tech1> and whitespace?
[2013-01-12 21:14:45] <Tech1> i remember it coming up
[2013-01-12 21:15:04] <Lurker69> i dont recall that
[2013-01-12 21:15:46] <Lurker69> soulseekah: did you found that jpg from yesterdays /x/ you were asking yabout 12 hours ago?
[2013-01-12 21:15:58] <soulseekah> no I needed the hash
[2013-01-12 21:15:59] <Lurker69> it had a hash on the bottom
[2013-01-12 21:16:06] <soulseekah> yes, wanted that hash
[2013-01-12 21:16:22] <Lurker69> "520b4f491d6eebc6e5a4b890a3d91700f6bd3140"\<--------------------------------
[2013-01-12 21:16:22] <soulseekah> still do, but I forgot what exactly I was wanting to do with it
[2013-01-12 21:16:24] <soulseekah> thanks
[2013-01-12 21:16:56] <dyadic> has all of the twitter hex data been used?
[2013-01-12 21:17:22] <Lurker69> http://images.4chan.org/x/src/1357843764943.jpg  this is the image   but it looks completely unrelated, not even troll to 3301 something comletely different
[2013-01-12 21:17:49] <soulseekah> dyadic, yes
[2013-01-12 21:18:04] <Lurker69> dyadic: i think yes, there was some data to much to mage jpg but it was just a filler: 33010330103301033010
[2013-01-12 21:18:31] <Lurker69> btw, i gues outguess works with filler and without it right?

[2013-01-12 21:19:18] <soulseekah> the filler was inside the .13 file when xoring with the twitter image
[2013-01-12 21:19:29] <soulseekah> since the outt.png is smaller than the runes.jpg
[2013-01-12 21:19:42] <soulseekah> they had to pad the extra data difference between png and jpg
[2013-01-12 21:19:49] <Tech1> ha, googiling that 520... hash returns a thread on /r/

[2013-01-12 21:22:42] <Lurker69> http://prntscr.com/oyn6z  this is what PS shows in properties about png, i have no idea what i am looking at
[2013-01-12 21:23:14] <Tech1> ha, nice soul
[2013-01-12 21:24:35] <soulseekah> it's gonna be pretty damn difficult to find a pattern in those values though
[2013-01-12 21:24:41] <soulseekah> nothing seems to jump out

[2013-01-12 21:25:46] <soulseekah> I'll upload a list of all the values only so the ones doing counting can do some
[2013-01-12 21:25:50] <Lurker69> sioul where did you pull thta from?
[2013-01-12 21:26:00] <soulseekah> from the PNG
[2013-01-12 21:26:09] <soulseekah> each number corresponds to the grayscale value
[2013-01-12 21:26:12] <soulseekah> in the PNG
[2013-01-12 21:26:20] <Lurker69> not with stego, jus plain gile?
[2013-01-12 21:26:21] <soulseekah> except I replaced all 0 with a .
[2013-01-12 21:27:41] <dyadic> are these after converting the png to a bitmap or just the raw png data

[2013-01-12 21:37:27] <soulseekah> PS doesn't do that most probably

[2013-01-12 21:39:55] <soulseekah> btw for those of you bruteforcing the dropbox filenames, dropbox prepends a unique hash before the file, i.e. https://www.dropbox.com/s/[unique]/3301
[2013-01-12 21:40:02] <soulseekah> so it's not bruteforcable
[2013-01-12 21:40:13] <soulseekah> or guessable

[2013-01-12 22:32:40] <Tech1> sup iIIustrious
[2013-01-12 22:32:57] <iIIustrious> did I miss anything? I've been mostly out for the last 12-24
[2013-01-12 22:33:11] <Tech1> not a damn thing
[2013-01-12 22:33:20] <Tech1> onion2.1 is back, no changes though
[2013-01-12 22:33:23] <Tech1> i think you know about that one
[2013-01-12 22:34:28] <iIIustrious> yeah, I' left some scripts running to try primes with extensions after the first thousand, I'm checking results now
[2013-01-12 22:34:39] <Tech1> i think soul hit up to 10k
[2013-01-12 22:35:03] <soulseekah> yep
[2013-01-12 22:35:18] <iIIustrious> mine's generating and trying them, I'll have to see how far it's got
[2013-01-12 22:35:33] <soulseekah> 10,000 first primes for about 8 extensions
[2013-01-12 22:36:07] <soulseekah> - .jpg .png .mp3 .txt .html .gif .txt.asc .php
[2013-01-12 22:36:17] <soulseekah> also about to finish 41k dictionary attack
[2013-01-12 22:36:26] <iIIustrious> and still nothing?
[2013-01-12 22:36:27] <soulseekah> + finished keywords from wiki attack
[2013-01-12 22:36:33] <soulseekah> no not a single hit
[2013-01-12 22:36:40] <soulseekah> except for index.thml and index
[2013-01-12 22:37:03] <Tech1> i think onion2.1 is uesless as of right now
[2013-01-12 22:37:10] <Tech1> well, i mean, obviously it is
[2013-01-12 22:37:11] <soulseekah> oh which reminds me that's what I wanted to do with the hash
[2013-01-12 22:37:17] <Tech1> Ooo
[2013-01-12 22:37:32] <Tech1> paste taht back into chat, i'll try it on the shell as well
[2013-01-12 22:37:33] <soulseekah> onion2 will certainly reveal a file to us

[2013-01-12 22:37:39] <Tech1> you think?

[2013-01-12 22:37:53] <soulseekah> (both metaphically and literally)
[2013-01-12 22:37:59] <Tech1> haha, good point
[2013-01-12 22:38:06] <Tech1> na, nothing with that hash
[2013-01-12 22:39:37] <soulseekah> confirmed
[2013-01-12 22:40:20] <soulseekah> I also ran it with numbers up to 1k, without padding, with single 0 padding, double 0 padding and triple 0 padding
[2013-01-12 22:41:08] <Tech1> hmmm
[2013-01-12 22:41:15] <iIIustrious> what's the hash from?
[2013-01-12 22:41:29] <soulseekah> some probably troll on x
[2013-01-12 22:41:55] <iIIustrious> ah
[2013-01-12 22:41:58] <iIIustrious> so not helpful
[2013-01-12 22:42:03] <Tech1> no
[2013-01-12 22:42:14] <Tech1> oddly enough, googleing the hash, retunrs a request in /r/

[2013-01-12 22:44:23] <Tech1> or maybe 3301 used the clue in the past
[2013-01-12 22:44:33] <Tech1> again, speculation
[2013-01-12 22:44:33] <soulseekah> still it coming up after 3 years

[2013-01-12 22:44:50] <Tech1> that can't just be random chance

[2013-01-12 22:57:59] <Tech1> still going to take years, haha, i'm hoping for an easy key
[2013-01-12 22:58:40] <soulseekah> looking at the PNG I'm thinking it could be possible the bits have been flipped for each of the luminosity values to reveal a binary code
[2013-01-12 22:59:20] <soulseekah> many of the gray parts contain darker or lighter dots (last bit 0 or 1) compared to their neighbors

[2013-01-12 23:02:08] <Tech1> soul: i think you're looking at the trees, not the forest :p
[2013-01-12 23:02:14] <Lurker69> lighter darker pixels are just because of "color  bleeding"
[2013-01-12 23:02:33] <Lurker69> if there is somethind in png it is in stego software or header
[2013-01-12 23:02:43] <Lurker69> pixels are all like they should be
[2013-01-12 23:06:13] <Tech1> i didn't see a damn thing in stego
[2013-01-12 23:06:20] <Tech1> but some of them want passwords to pull data out
[2013-01-12 23:06:26] <Tech1> i tried 3301 / 1033 / cicada
[2013-01-12 23:07:15] <soulseekah> well bitflipping is extensively used esp. in lossless formats
[2013-01-12 23:07:38] <soulseekah> but not sure about greyscale, too evident it seems with only 16 degrees of freedom
[2013-01-12 23:08:12] <soulseekah> the change from one level to the next would bee too evident
[2013-01-12 23:08:42] <soulseekah> tried it out, extracted all LSBs from non zero values, nothing
[2013-01-12 23:08:50] =-= bak|out is now known as bakpak2hvy
[2013-01-12 23:08:56] <bakpak2hvy> any news on the onion?
[2013-01-12 23:09:22] <Tech1> no changes if that's what you mean
[2013-01-12 23:09:23] <soulseekah> no
[2013-01-12 23:12:06] <soulseekah> all primes are odd except 2 right?
[2013-01-12 23:12:34] <Ymgve> yes
[2013-01-12 23:12:41] <Ymgve> because all even numbers can be divided by 2
[2013-01-12 23:13:10] <soulseekah> </reality check>
[2013-01-12 23:17:58] <Tech1> blah
[2013-01-12 23:18:02] <Tech1> so we are no where.
[2013-01-12 23:18:07] <Tech1> or no further
[2013-01-12 23:19:01] <soulseekah> there's always a direction to move along
[2013-01-12 23:21:07] <soulseekah> whether that direction leads to anywhere is another thing
[2013-01-12 23:21:43] <Tech1> good point
[2013-01-12 23:23:14] <Tech1> hmm. we completed 'xor all the things!' right?
[2013-01-12 23:23:32] <soulseekah> it's impossible to complete it
[2013-01-12 23:23:43] <Tech1> well, yeah, offsets, skip, etc
[2013-01-12 23:24:11] <soulseekah> yep, one of my current deployments is bruteforcing everything with everythign at offsets of fist 10k primes
[2013-01-12 23:24:34] <soulseekah> flagging any potential magic bytes for review

[2013-01-12 23:25:28] <Tech1> any specific files?
[2013-01-12 23:25:40] <soulseekah> 24 files being xored with one another at 10k different prime offsets
[2013-01-12 23:25:58] <soulseekah> so yes so far I manage to come up with 24 files to xor around with
[2013-01-12 23:26:14] <soulseekah> these include reversals, undecoded and encoded versions of stuff we have
[2013-01-12 23:26:26] <soulseekah> but I'm probably missing something, I think I'm not xoring the forest message
[2013-01-12 23:26:32] <soulseekah> yep it's not on there
[2013-01-12 23:27:04] <soulseekah> I'll cry if it turns out that forest had to be xord
[2013-01-12 23:27:16] <Tech1> you have it in hex?
[2013-01-12 23:27:24] <Tech1> i'll throw it at some stuff
[2013-01-12 23:27:43] <soulseekah> nope it's not among my files atm
[2013-01-12 23:28:10] <Tech1> the original output on the wiki, i think?
[2013-01-12 23:28:17] <soulseekah> yep should be on there
[2013-01-12 23:28:24] <Ymgve> soulseekah: err, the forest message was xored with _560.00
[2013-01-12 23:28:32] <Ymgve> the data you get from "hint"
[2013-01-12 23:28:36] <soulseekah> sure it was
[2013-01-12 23:28:53] <Ymgve> are you saying your code doesn't find it?
[2013-01-12 23:29:08] <soulseekah> I'm saying I've disregarded it in all my current bruteforce setups
[2013-01-12 23:29:16] <Ymgve> oh
[2013-01-12 23:29:19] <Ymgve> right
[2013-01-12 23:29:24] <Tech1> include the gpg sig?
[2013-01-12 23:29:25] <soulseekah> I have regarded the hello message though
[2013-01-12 23:29:37] <soulseekah> but one thing that i'm realizing is
[2013-01-12 23:30:20] <soulseekah> from all this heavy bruteforcing non stop on several workstations is how much "everyting with everything" excludes
[2013-01-12 23:30:49] <soulseekah> and how probable it is that in the end the answer will lie in something that hasn't been regarded/tried
[2013-01-12 23:31:12] <soulseekah> which is quite discouraging
[2013-01-12 23:31:25] <Ymgve> I'm pretty sure we have to wait more
[2013-01-12 23:31:27] <Ymgve> which sucks
[2013-01-12 23:31:35] <soulseekah> I can't even fathom xoring combinations of 3 files
[2013-01-12 23:31:36] <Tech1> yeah, i think eventually the 2nd onion will change
[2013-01-12 23:31:40] <soulseekah> with offsets
[2013-01-12 23:32:07] <soulseekah> but I'll go setup a bruteforcer with offsets 0 for all 24 files I have in combinations of 3
[2013-01-12 23:32:16] <soulseekah> probably permutations is the correct term here
[2013-01-12 23:32:55] <soulseekah> Ymgve, may certainly be, but nothing is saying we have to wait any longer
[2013-01-12 23:33:08] <soulseekah> although nothing's been saying that since onion2 went down after saying that
[2013-01-12 23:34:10] <Ymgve> onion1 still points to onion2, right?
[2013-01-12 23:34:20] <Tech1> yeah, dont think that message has changed
[2013-01-12 23:34:52] <soulseekah> it hasn't when I checked earlier today
[2013-01-12 23:35:01] <Tech1> 0x3cf 2d0a
[2013-01-12 23:35:05] <Tech1> yeah, i think that's right
[2013-01-12 23:35:56] <soulseekah> the middle has the message
[2013-01-12 23:36:11] <soulseekah> first bytes are always the same ---BEGIN ... bla bla

[2013-01-13 00:35:18] <soulseekah> so question for all, what piece of technology hides itself when actively looking/analyzing it?
[2013-01-13 00:37:02] <soulseekah> or pehaps hides a subset of its data when actively used as planned
[2013-01-13 00:38:01] <soulseekah> and hides in such a way that it's impossible to use the hidden subset of data
[2013-01-13 00:38:14] <Tech1> isn't there some AV evasion like that?
[2013-01-13 00:39:29] <dyadic> polymorphic stuff, but that would be meaningless with data files
[2013-01-13 00:39:37] <dyadic> are you referring to the onion sites maybe?
[2013-01-13 00:39:46] <soulseekah> I'm thinking of something down to earth, non-exotic
[2013-01-13 00:40:11] <soulseekah> but yes what you said fits the description certainly
[2013-01-13 00:40:24] <soulseekah> thinking more perhaps filesystem-wise
[2013-01-13 00:40:31] <Tech1> i thought polymorphic AV evasion was only during the compiling though
[2013-01-13 00:41:03] <dyadic> Tech1: no, self-replicating polymorphic malware is pretty old

[2013-01-13 00:41:12] <dyadic> also why av software is bs, largely
[2013-01-13 00:42:00] <soulseekah> one example would be to burn a bootable iso and boot from it, it effectively renders the contents of the booted iso unreadable on a regular computer right? because what is mounted is a ramdisk by the bootloader

[2013-01-13 02:11:29] <soulseekah> the automated one you speak of
[2013-01-13 02:12:39] <lulzorz> it's spread across the network
[2013-01-13 02:12:49] <lulzorz> there are hidden service directory authorities
[2013-01-13 02:13:03] <lulzorz> and each hidden service is assigned to three of them
[2013-01-13 02:13:07] <soulseekah> I see
[2013-01-13 02:13:10] <lulzorz> based on the keyspace rotation
[2013-01-13 02:13:12] <Tech1> ...go on..
[2013-01-13 02:13:24] <lulzorz> so to find the onion that anon posted, if it existed
[2013-01-13 02:13:42] <lulzorz> one would simply brute force a key to land right after the address
[2013-01-13 02:13:59] <lulzorz> and then make one's node a hidden service directory authority
[2013-01-13 02:14:03] <lulzorz> and then wait 18 hours
[2013-01-13 02:14:06] <lulzorz> (or less)
[2013-01-13 02:14:15] <lulzorz> of course, you'd need a hella patched client, I'm sure...
[2013-01-13 02:14:45] <soulseekah> sweet stuff https://raw.github.com/katmagic/Shallot/master/README.asciidoc
[2013-01-13 02:15:06] <soulseekah> that's how they got the sms4tor address I bet
[2013-01-13 02:15:17] <soulseekah> so it's genreated from the private key rather than the public key
[2013-01-13 02:15:56] <lulzorz> irrelevant
[2013-01-13 02:16:15] <absolutezeroff> sms4tor thing was troll if we're talking about the same thing
[2013-01-13 02:16:24] <lulzorz> I mean, it really does not matter from an attack surface perspective
[2013-01-13 02:16:42] <lulzorz> absolutezeroff: I was talking about the XXX address posted the other day
[2013-01-13 02:16:44] <soulseekah> I mean the sms4tor .onion domain
[2013-01-13 02:16:48] <soulseekah> it started with sms4tor....
[2013-01-13 02:16:58] <lulzorz> soulseekah: that was trolling...
[2013-01-13 02:17:02] <soulseekah> which had to be generated from a public key until hit
[2013-01-13 02:17:14] <soulseekah> it doesn't exist?
[2013-01-13 02:17:29] <lulzorz> oh, you mean the vanity addr?
[2013-01-13 02:17:45] <lulzorz> yeah, there's this thing called shallot (IIRC) that does bruteforcing of onion addrs
[2013-01-13 02:17:51] <soulseekah> ....
[2013-01-13 02:17:56] <soulseekah> which is what I referred to above
[2013-01-13 02:17:59] <soulseekah> the readme is for shallot
[2013-01-13 02:18:08] <lulzorz> we found it last year while trying to figure out why we were outguessing the lady of shallot

[2013-01-13 02:53:53] <soulseekah> what you can try is halve the 2nd part where it first goes forward

[2013-01-13 02:59:21] <dyadic> I posted an img of the spectrum a bit ago

[2013-01-13 02:59:50] <Tech1> let me see if i can expand the song length.  i have no idea what i'm doing with audio stuff.
[2013-01-13 02:59:53] <soulseekah> try looking at 1-2 second intervals and see if therea re patterns
[2013-01-13 03:00:10] <dyadic> I don't think its an artefact
[2013-01-13 03:00:15] <dyadic> it's*
[2013-01-13 03:00:23] <Cosmo_> Well it looks like I came back at the right time. Yay audio stuff. What's up?
[2013-01-13 03:00:44] <dyadic> Cosmo_: sharp peak at ~15.5khz, why?
[2013-01-13 03:00:45] <dyadic> :)
[2013-01-13 03:00:56] <Tech1> looks like a band.
[2013-01-13 03:01:04] <dyadic> out in the middle of nowhere, barely audible area
[2013-01-13 03:01:10] <Tech1> stars like 1-2 seconds in, continues the whole song
[2013-01-13 03:01:18] <dyadic> persists throughout the full length yeah
[2013-01-13 03:01:19] <Cosmo_> I've been thinking about that, it's hard to know. That's the limit for most hearing.

[2013-01-13 03:01:25] <dyadic> yes
[2013-01-13 03:01:25] <Cosmo_> The upper band of hearing anyway
[2013-01-13 03:01:32] <Tech1> not to mention quality speakers
[2013-01-13 03:01:35] <soulseekah> though notice how
[2013-01-13 03:01:43] <dyadic> and the sample rate isn't low enough for it to be an artefact of sampling
[2013-01-13 03:01:45] <soulseekah> the initial cicada mono sample does not have it
[2013-01-13 03:01:50] <soulseekah> meaning it came from another source
[2013-01-13 03:01:58] <soulseekah> then it gradually mixed into the first part of the song
[2013-01-13 03:02:06] <Tech1> it's sharply segmented too, it only falls within a few hz range
[2013-01-13 03:02:10] <soulseekah> the song contained that from the start probably
[2013-01-13 03:02:14] <Cosmo_> I want to put it down to background noise, but that's a really odd place to have it.
[2013-01-13 03:02:18] <soulseekah> 2nd song is chopped and screwed 1st song
[2013-01-13 03:02:33] <Cosmo_> Anyone tried putting a bass cut on it? I did one but not detailed
[2013-01-13 03:02:41] <Tech1> 15621 - 15665 i'd guess
[2013-01-13 03:02:50] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: could be a power converter
[2013-01-13 03:03:23] <Cosmo_> True, we don't know WHERE it was recorded and i'm used to studio recordings
[2013-01-13 03:03:30] <dyadic> I could put a pass band around the peak but not here

[2013-01-13 03:24:35] <Cosmo_> The problem with sound is there are no perfections
[2013-01-13 03:25:08] <soulseekah> yeh, these imperfections sometimes seem weird
[2013-01-13 03:25:41] <Tech1> soul: also, your bash script for file guessing
[2013-01-13 03:25:48] <Aloo> Cosmo, how do you decode audio?
[2013-01-13 03:26:12] <soulseekah> Tech1, file guessing?
[2013-01-13 03:26:30] <Tech1> the flags?
[2013-01-13 03:26:47] <Cosmo_> Good question. That's my weakness I'm afraid.
[2013-01-13 03:26:53] <Cosmo_> Hang on lemme ask a guy here
[2013-01-13 03:27:00] <Aloo> sure babe
[2013-01-13 03:27:29] <Cosmo_> Babe? you'll be lucky if I answer.
[2013-01-13 03:27:31] <soulseekah> oh it's a for i,j in `cat xorlist`; xor i j 0 0 | head | file -

[2013-01-13 03:29:14] <Tech1> checking it meow
[2013-01-13 03:29:20] <Cosmo_> Earlier I tried a 'deconstruct'. I have a programme at uni designed to 'recognise' seperate instruments and with a not bad degree of accuracy seperate them
[2013-01-13 03:29:44] <soulseekah> Tech1, xor.py is http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=cyTuaCZd
[2013-01-13 03:30:02] <Tech1> i've got that one, been using it
[2013-01-13 03:30:07] <soulseekah> k
[2013-01-13 03:30:10] <Cosmo_> Everything in music coding is around transforms, but then comes the issue. mp3's are notoriously hard to deconstruct because the way they are coded means they're awful quality
[2013-01-13 03:30:56] <Cosmo_> The issue is if they did what would be normal, bounce the sound s a master, THEN make it an mp3, it's already fairly damaged
[2013-01-13 03:31:12] <Tech1> and xorlist is space seperated list of files?
[2013-01-13 03:31:15] <soulseekah> how part 2 sounds (with its artifacts and impurities) really seems to hint at the fact taht sometings hidden in the actual waves though
[2013-01-13 03:31:21] <soulseekah> Tech1, \n separated
[2013-01-13 03:31:24] <Tech1> kk
[2013-01-13 03:31:30] <soulseekah> space should work too
[2013-01-13 03:31:41] <Tech1> \n is prettier
[2013-01-13 03:31:42] <Tech1> haha
[2013-01-13 03:32:04] <Cosmo_> And if they did the other way, bounce the master tracks STRAIGHT into an mp3 the transfer does something weird. It takes a snapshot of each instrument track at any given millisecond, meaning you only hear one instrument at a time
[2013-01-13 03:32:17] <Cosmo_> They're played so fast your brain hears them as one
[2013-01-13 03:32:41] <Aloo> Cosmo : that isn't how it's done proff'ly though... is it?
[2013-01-13 03:33:19] <Cosmo_> If there's something hidden in the waves the problem isn't finding it, it's seperating it from an already messy sound.
[2013-01-13 03:33:31] <Cosmo_> And no, professionally 'mp3' is a swear word.
[2013-01-13 03:33:37] <Tech1> flac?

[2013-01-13 03:34:00] <soulseekah> ah b ut see, the sound is messy
[2013-01-13 03:34:06] <soulseekah> because there's something in it
[2013-01-13 03:34:18] <soulseekah> the injection of hidden data messed up the sound
[2013-01-13 03:34:19] <Tech1> don't we have a ton of audio guys in OTP22?
[2013-01-13 03:34:23] <soulseekah> why mess it up on purpose
[2013-01-13 03:34:24] <Tech1> can't we pull someone?

[2013-01-13 03:34:43] <soulseekah> bit twiddling is not as straight forward in mp3, compared to say PCM
[2013-01-13 03:34:58] <dyadic> I know
[2013-01-13 03:34:58] <Cosmo_> Find someone with full-time access to the software needed. And no pcm would be a dream
[2013-01-13 03:35:06] <soulseekah> but converting to PCM is probably a no go
[2013-01-13 03:35:11] <soulseekah> will lose much
[2013-01-13 03:35:22] <Cosmo_> Every conversion does more damage

[2013-01-13 03:36:13] <soulseekah> most of the time with puzzles involving sound - it's either very evident in the spectrogram, or using subtraction
[2013-01-13 03:36:25] <soulseekah> this one has nothing evident
[2013-01-13 03:36:34] <soulseekah> other than weird damage
[2013-01-13 03:36:50] <dyadic> did anybody try mp3stego on it
[2013-01-13 03:36:55] <Cosmo_> That's the problem. I've looked at it every way i know how.
[2013-01-13 03:37:03] <soulseekah> Tech1, is our steg guy, dyadic he did
[2013-01-13 03:37:10] <Tech1> dyadic: yeah, propmpts for password, which i dont' have
[2013-01-13 03:37:15] <Tech1> tried the usual suspects
[2013-01-13 03:37:28] <soulseekah> Tech1, idea just popped into my head
[2013-01-13 03:37:31] <nadando> did anyone ever do a transcription of the notes?
[2013-01-13 03:37:33] <dyadic> all right
[2013-01-13 03:37:35] <soulseekah> would a regular mp3 prompt for pass?
[2013-01-13 03:37:43] <Cosmo_> I've spent ages on any section that has interested me.
[2013-01-13 03:37:46] <Tech1> ..valid point. le tme check one of mine
[2013-01-13 03:37:46] <soulseekah> or would it error out as in "no hidden data"
[2013-01-13 03:38:02] <dyadic> I'd guess you'd get two differing error messages
[2013-01-13 03:38:12] <dyadic> invalid password/no data
[2013-01-13 03:38:13] <soulseekah> if it's evident that there's hidden data, then we start bruteforcers on it
[2013-01-13 03:38:19] <Cosmo_> I believe they do actually, the programme assumes YOU put something in.
[2013-01-13 03:38:26] <soulseekah> if it assumes it's hidden from the beginning
[2013-01-13 03:38:27] <Tech1> ^ is what i'd assume
[2013-01-13 03:38:28] <soulseekah> then no point
[2013-01-13 03:38:54] <soulseekah> depends on how it works
[2013-01-13 03:39:01] <soulseekah> sometimes it's evindent ther's nothin in
[2013-01-13 03:39:08] <soulseekah> many stegs put markers
[2013-01-13 03:39:17] <dyadic> I tried steghide but same problem
[2013-01-13 03:39:32] <Cosmo_> I tried the same with a programme that doesn't require a password, but there's so many ways to do a steg it's like a doing a rubiks cube blindfolded without ever looking at it
[2013-01-13 03:39:33] <dyadic> I don't think it supports mp3 anyway tho
[2013-01-13 03:40:14] <dyadic> so what *hasn't* been used so far

[2013-01-13 03:40:51] <soulseekah> audio of the mp3
[2013-01-13 03:40:56] <soulseekah> rune values
[2013-01-13 03:42:23] <soulseekah> the bitchy thing about the gematria is that the assigned values go way below printable ascii
[2013-01-13 03:42:33] <Cosmo_> I've been wondering about the end of the mp3 more today than anything else.
[2013-01-13 03:42:45] <soulseekah> where it seems to gap a couple of times?
[2013-01-13 03:43:01] <Cosmo_> Yeah.
[2013-01-13 03:43:19] <soulseekah> can't be denied that one of the XOR is actually in gematria values
[2013-01-13 03:43:33] <Cosmo_> It's because that as an effect as far as i know doesn't exist as a preset  or plug-in it has to occur naturally as an error, or be done manually.
[2013-01-13 03:43:33] <soulseekah> which is unreadable and unprintable
[2013-01-13 03:43:59] <soulseekah> I hear it as a simple volume automation envelope
[2013-01-13 03:44:08] <soulseekah> but it doesn't make sense
[2013-01-13 03:44:20] <Aloo> Cosmo, have you inverted and and reversed?
[2013-01-13 03:44:40] <Cosmo_> Yep
[2013-01-13 03:45:14] <Aloo> The notes that had been reversed
[2013-01-13 03:45:21] <Aloo> aren't really melodic
[2013-01-13 03:45:25] <Aloo> or in key
[2013-01-13 03:45:26] <Cosmo_> I've reversed, combined, subtracted, put frequency filters all the way up, created every kind of graph i know exists.... I've got nowhere.
[2013-01-13 03:45:42] <Cosmo_> I noticed that too, but they're all on the one string for that slide tone
[2013-01-13 03:45:54] <Aloo> which string is that?
[2013-01-13 03:45:55] <Aloo> e?
[2013-01-13 03:45:57] <Cosmo_> It could be an artistic choice.
[2013-01-13 03:46:07] <Aloo> Cicada + artistic?
[2013-01-13 03:46:11] <Cosmo_> I don't know i'd have to play it again but g i think
[2013-01-13 03:46:17] <Tech1> ha, assuming they wrote the song
[2013-01-13 03:46:25] <Cosmo_> Tell me what they've done isn't a work of art
[2013-01-13 03:46:33] <Cosmo_> tech that's the whole other question
[2013-01-13 03:46:33] <Tech1> it absolutely is
[2013-01-13 03:46:44] <Tech1> exactly
[2013-01-13 03:46:57] <Aloo> How do you select one side of the song individually?
[2013-01-13 03:47:00] <Cosmo_> Consider the implications. If they wrote it, why? It's not a complicated piece and could have been recorded far better

[2013-01-13 03:47:25] <Aloo> I hate logging in everytime
[2013-01-13 03:47:30] <soulseekah> Aloo, if you're in Audacity, click on the track options and split I think
[2013-01-13 03:47:36] <soulseekah> you end up with two tracks
[2013-01-13 03:47:45] <Cosmo_> Of the stereo track? Import it to audacity, then on the channel options on the left of the audio, drop down menu split stereo teack
[2013-01-13 03:47:47] <soulseekah> also there's an Unlink option to keep it stereo
[2013-01-13 03:47:48] <Aloo> I have, but they still act as one piece when altered
[2013-01-13 03:48:19] <Cosmo_> You must have selected them both before putting an effect on.

[2013-01-13 04:05:38] <dyadic> ah ok

[2013-01-13 04:06:03] <Cosmo_> It's not inhumane, it's annoying, but it's hardly an encroachment on our freedom
[2013-01-13 04:06:08] <dyadic> they have a refrigerator tax based on the size of the refrigerator
[2013-01-13 04:06:10] <Tech1> literally a man comes to the door and walks around to see if you have a radio
[2013-01-13 04:06:16] <Aloo> No, i thought you're paying just to own one.
[2013-01-13 04:06:17] <dyadic> some guy comes into your house and measures your refrigerators

[2013-01-13 04:21:42] <rr645> The rumor was around last year that some of their work was already in the wild, without proper official authorship
[2013-01-13 04:22:34] <Cosmo_> Any examples?
[2013-01-13 04:22:47] <rr645> None that anyone could work out.
[2013-01-13 04:23:35] <dyadic> if their work remains unattributed, then they can't have a poor public image, and nothing they do could be distorted or misrepresented
[2013-01-13 04:23:49] <dyadic> not saying that it is all benevolent though, who knows what they're really up to

[2013-01-13 04:24:33] <dyadic> better for any such organization to remain unknown I think
[2013-01-13 04:24:35] <Cosmo_> I'd love to know what they do.
[2013-01-13 04:25:26] <Lurker69> i gues it is just development of encrypted protocols, that is what is needed, that is what will save us
[2013-01-13 04:25:46] <dyadic> has to be more than that
[2013-01-13 04:25:51] <Lurker69> but there is no way to know for sure

[2013-01-13 04:27:12] <dyadic> yeah, dissemination of information at key places/times sounds likely
[2013-01-13 04:27:21] <Lurker69> also consider  that it actually doesnt matter if we are in cicada or not, we  can start developing new cipher tomorow if we want and stop fiddling with that puzzles

[2013-01-13 04:27:55] <dyadic> developing new ciphers isn't an amateur job though.  it really is best to use widely available tools, that have been tested
[2013-01-13 04:27:59] <Lurker69> but dsadyl it is not
[2013-01-13 04:28:14] <Cosmo_> Not to everyone.
[2013-01-13 04:28:36] <dyadic> mathematical proof for such systems is too difficult, testing by experts, and vetting in the wild
[2013-01-13 04:28:44] <dyadic> is the only way
[2013-01-13 04:29:01] <dyadic> which means developing such cryptosystems behind closed doors would be a poor idea

[2013-01-13 04:51:16] <dyadic> might be we are missing some...lore though
[2013-01-13 04:51:23] <dyadic> especially given the rune table
[2013-01-13 04:52:01] <Cosmo_> I went along the history route, but i didn't find any obvious connections. Probably worth another look
[2013-01-13 04:52:42] <rr645> dyadic--true, we still haven't fully worked out why they split the runes into two alphabets, have we? Or for that matter, why use runes at all, and not just Latin?

[2013-01-13 04:55:36] <dyadic> rr645: the runes might appear in some image
[2013-01-13 04:55:44] <dyadic> or some text that is referenced
[2013-01-13 04:55:56] <dyadic> or as spoken aloud in some audio

[2013-01-13 06:20:56] <Haile> I have an order for mimosa hostillis and am gonna brew up some of taht shit
[2013-01-13 06:20:59] <Haile> considering selling for like $200 a gram
[2013-01-13 06:21:05] <Haile> because fuck everyone else
[2013-01-13 06:21:07] <Haile> make $$$$

[2013-01-13 06:26:10] <dyadic> do work brah
[2013-01-13 06:27:25] <Haile> It's very simple too. I don't use lye or caustic materials.  I simply heat  the Hostillis root in water just below boiling. It cooks down to slush oil, I combine distilled water with 2 1/2 cups of lemon juice and/or vinegar. Drop the oil in the water and the Dimethyltriptamine will bind to the acid. Then add baking soda. Pour on a flat dish and let evaporate
[2013-01-13 06:27:31] <Haile> Boom DMT/Baking soda crystals
[2013-01-13 06:27:41] <Haile> Separting the baking soda from the DMT is easy too
[2013-01-13 06:29:06] <Haile> Pretty sure it's rubbing alcohol. The soda fucks off and dissapears and you evaporate the alcohol  for pure ass chunky DMT goodness
[2013-01-13 06:29:12] <Haile> Oh yeah lol fuck the police
[2013-01-13 06:29:26] <nadando> how much are you making?
[2013-01-13 06:30:36] <Haile> Well it depends on how much Hostillis root I can get/want to spend on it since it's a trial run. I am gonna get at least 50 grams of Hostillis maybe 100 grams.
[2013-01-13 06:30:40] <Haile> I think it should make
[2013-01-13 06:30:45] <Haile> one sec let me calculate
[2013-01-13 06:31:36] <Haile> Okay I really don't know how much it's going to male
[2013-01-13 06:31:37] <Haile> make
[2013-01-13 06:31:47] <Haile> I'll be happy with like 5 grams
[2013-01-13 06:32:22] <Haile> Actually more like 3
[2013-01-13 06:32:39] <Haile> Cause a single dose it only 50-60mg
[2013-01-13 06:33:22] <Haile> Has anyone tried it before?
[2013-01-13 06:33:38] <Haile> I am only making it so I can try it out :3

[2013-01-13 12:02:21] <Gibemoniplos> There's also some Cicada soundtracks. We should try to match them with the start of the mp3

[2013-01-13 12:05:03] <Gibemoniplos> Interesting chat on anonpaste
[2013-01-13 12:05:44] <Gibemoniplos> We still need to connect the numbers 1,595, 277,641 with Euler or The golden ratio
[2013-01-13 12:06:32] <Lurker69> we think 1,595, 277,641 is one number
[2013-01-13 12:06:34] <Gibemoniplos> What if the numbers were coordinates (1,595)(277,641) in a parable of form ax^2+bx+c, and phi is a?
[2013-01-13 12:06:42] <Gibemoniplos> Hm, that's also possible
[2013-01-13 12:07:09] <Lurker69> 1595 277641 = 1031 x 1229 x 1259 
[2013-01-13 12:07:31] <Gibemoniplos> These numbers are included in the missing primes, yes?
[2013-01-13 12:07:35] <Lurker69> 1031, 1229,  1259, and 1595277641are all emirps, numbers that are prime when written backwards.
[2013-01-13 12:08:16] <Gibemoniplos> That's pretty crazy
[2013-01-13 12:08:19] <Lurker69> teitter number is even more it is palendromis (same backwards as forwars)
[2013-01-13 12:08:46] <Gibemoniplos> Yeah, I saw that on the twitter number - any use for it yet?
[2013-01-13 12:08:56] <Lurker69> also lots of primes mentioned are twin primes = menaing they are nexto to each oter only one even number between them

[2013-01-13 14:52:50] <Tech1> for sure soul
[2013-01-13 14:53:00] <Tech1> i added AND and OR to that python
[2013-01-13 14:53:19] <Tech1> stdout it all to a text file, easy enough to read

[2013-01-13 15:03:08] <soulseekah|null> looks good
[2013-01-13 15:03:17] <soulseekah|null> I always wanted to read input from stdin though
[2013-01-13 15:03:20] <soulseekah|null> never got around to it
[2013-01-13 15:03:34] <soulseekah|null> so we can pipe like crazy
[2013-01-13 15:03:42] <Tech1> hmm
[2013-01-13 15:03:48] <Tech1> i see the logic
[2013-01-13 15:04:02] <soulseekah|null> also remove authorship info, not relevant
[2013-01-13 15:04:09] <Tech1> touche
[2013-01-13 15:04:32] <Tech1> old habbit. haha
[2013-01-13 15:08:03] <soulseekah|null> also you can omit multiple with statements
[2013-01-13 15:08:08] <soulseekah|null> and shove all operations under one
[2013-01-13 15:08:18] <soulseekah|null> just seek back every time
[2013-01-13 15:08:24] <Tech1> i tried that at first, it didn't takkke..
[2013-01-13 15:08:30] <Tech1> because i didn't re-seek
[2013-01-13 15:08:35] <Tech1> sigh.gif
[2013-01-13 15:09:16] <soulseekah|null> reseeking when writing may not make sense, but reading will certainly work
[2013-01-13 15:10:09] <Tech1> yeah, i got it
[2013-01-13 15:10:29] <soulseekah|null> just removing the two with statements before each seek should work
[2013-01-13 15:10:40] <Tech1> yup
[2013-01-13 15:10:41] <soulseekah|null> indentation stays the same
[2013-01-13 15:11:02] <soulseekah|null> saves you 4 open and 4 close syscalls
[2013-01-13 15:11:21] <soulseekah|null> when bruteforcing will amount up to saved minutes for sure
[2013-01-13 15:12:14] <Ymgve> if you are worried about that you should first read things into memory, then do the xor
[2013-01-13 15:12:52] <soulseekah|null> right
[2013-01-13 15:15:25] <soulseekah|null> ...or use ramfs without rewriting anything

[2013-01-13 16:44:17] <Lurker69> http://www.mediafire.com/?21ctr9j2i5hkbsq   files from my testing with twitter profile pic
[2013-01-13 16:44:41] <Lurker69> i can make twitter  to create same image for profile as cicada has on its profile
[2013-01-13 16:45:05] <Lurker69> cicadas profile pic is moved up for HALF pixel  ????
[2013-01-13 16:45:37] <Lurker69> it is possible that they hane jpg of csame image and used jpg to upload on twitter adn then savesame pic to png in image editor
[2013-01-13 16:45:55] <Lurker69> coversion from jpg to png can cause that half pixel offset
[2013-01-13 16:46:04] <Lurker69> or some resampling resizing

[2013-01-13 16:55:25] <anon1234> any of you thought that the wisdom file is some kind of ascii art?
[2013-01-13 16:55:44] <anon1234> i mean the tor page had an ascii art in the welcome page
[2013-01-13 16:55:45] <Lurker69> hmm
[2013-01-13 16:56:17] <Lurker69> i also think that  forest/tree clue wasnt interpreted as it should be yet
[2013-01-13 16:56:23] <rr645> It's pretty gibberishy compared to that cicada made of 7s, though
[2013-01-13 16:56:34] <Lurker69> currently i am thinking about nnew stergo software fro .png
[2013-01-13 16:56:54] <anon1234> the ascii art kinda fits the forest thingy
[2013-01-13 16:57:42] <Lurker69> maybe some clue is clue to which stego to use  http://www.jjtc.com/Steganography/tools.html  i didnt check the list yet, and there might be other stego programs in the wild
[2013-01-13 16:58:06] <Lurker69> to be hinest from last years clue i wouldnt figure out you have to outguess it

[2013-01-13 19:13:01] <D90> There is a total of 6 loss ends, am I correct ?
[2013-01-13 19:13:56] <soulseekah> probably
[2013-01-13 19:15:12] <soulseekah> looking at the puzzles from last year they had been very easy
[2013-01-13 19:15:34] <soulseekah> straightforward connections, clues, hints
[2013-01-13 19:15:46] <soulseekah> nothing like what we're currently with now
[2013-01-13 19:16:11] <Lurker69> i think that it is not just all the same as last year, we must be missing something
[2013-01-13 19:16:47] <Lurker69> and there must be some other tricks beside XOR and stuff from last year
[2013-01-13 19:17:10] <Tech1> the image dimensions, but i wasn't able to come up with anything relevant
[2013-01-13 19:17:49] <Lurker69> http://boards.4chan.org/sci/res/5414358#p5435629   dont try, do it!
[2013-01-13 19:17:57] <dyadic> yeah, missing stuff, also it might be more difficult this year as more people are probably participating
[2013-01-13 19:18:04] <dyadic> so they must be more selective
[2013-01-13 19:18:09] <Lurker69> yeah image dimension are also another loose end
[2013-01-13 19:18:32] <Lurker69> actually all mentioned primes are loose ends we didnt use any of them besides twitter account
[2013-01-13 19:18:51] <D90> Why using prime numbers ?
[2013-01-13 19:18:57] <dyadic> are image dimensions listed on the wiki
[2013-01-13 19:19:22] <Tech1> dyadic a few are under important primes
[2013-01-13 19:20:08] <Lurker69> who found twitter?  maybe there are similar acounts on other pages, facebook, hi5, myspace, piratebay, wikileaks, reddit....
[2013-01-13 19:20:39] <dyadic> could the numbers in the mp3 be coordinates for a rectangle of an image
[2013-01-13 19:20:42] <Lurker69> d90: cicada is all about primes ,primes are very important in cryptography
[2013-01-13 19:20:45] <dyadic> there are 4 of them
[2013-01-13 19:20:58] <dyadic> it would depend on whether they are y1,x1,y2,x2 or what

[2013-01-13 20:19:04] <soulseekah> maybe each number in wisdom folly = chapter number

[2013-01-13 20:20:21] <soulseekah> 208 is last chapter
[2013-01-13 20:20:29] <soulseekah> well within the 0xff limit
[2013-01-13 20:20:50] <soulseekah> although I see a byte with value of 249 in wisdom/folly
[2013-01-13 20:21:39] <soulseekah> + it seems the chapters are labled A..Z BA...BZ and so on
[2013-01-13 20:22:37] <soulseekah> will see if I can find it in text and xor wisdom at all offsets
[2013-01-13 20:24:36] <soulseekah> bakpak2hvy, it's probably greek though what does it mean: ΕΠΙΣΤΛΗ ΤΩΥ ΜΕΓΑΛΟΥ ΘΗΡΙΟΥ ΠΡΟΣ ΤΟΝ ΥΙΟΝ ΑΥΤΟΓΕΣΡΑΜΜΑΤΟΝ

[2013-01-13 20:54:52] <Lurker69> As I know, Crowley took for himself the title of the great beast 666. In his Liber Alvel Legis (The book of the loi) he let us a cryptogramme :
[2013-01-13 20:54:52] <Lurker69> 4638ABK24aLGMOR3YX2489RPSTOVAL
[2013-01-13 20:54:52] <Lurker69> Nobody was able to find the key. Maybe those who undestand the kabbale could translate this and let us know what Crowley really wanted to say.
[2013-01-13 20:54:52] <Lurker69> He had used mediums (see Victor Neuberg in 1910) to find answers to his questions and proclame them as propheties.
[2013-01-13 20:54:53] <Lurker69> In my opinion, he was just a social psychopath.
[2013-01-13 20:54:55] <soulseekah> also xorers, bear in mind, that xor can produce gematria-encoded results, which are decoded with the rune table
[2013-01-13 20:55:50] <soulseekah> In my opinion, it's just bits and bytes.
[2013-01-13 20:55:54] <Tech1> we should probably setup a public dropbox folder for all files

[2013-01-14 03:23:33] <Lurker69> so  it is possible that cicada uploaded jpg version of that png or thy changed png after they uploaded it to twitter

[2013-01-14 03:31:25] <Lurker69> if you would upload the same pic cicada did you should get exact same png but that doesnt happen, cicadas pnf is slightly repositioned

[2013-01-14 04:42:35] <Cosmo_> I like that question.
[2013-01-14 04:42:55] <Cosmo_> Not 'do we need it'? Because that's a question that is unanswerable
[2013-01-14 04:43:23] <Lurker69> video is nicely asking if we really need so much "protection"
[2013-01-14 04:43:54] <Cosmo_> It's a good video. I like the side comments "Don't break the first rule, maybe the 100th rule if we're offered a lot of money"
[2013-01-14 04:43:56] <Lurker69> i would like to thry to live in the world without so many police  and so much controll, maybe a bit of anrchsy would be benefitial

[2013-01-14 04:46:55] <Lurker69> and it is true iw we lock ourself in the cages because there are "preditores" outthere...   that means  they win and we can just cut our balls because we dont need them anymore
[2013-01-14 04:47:24] <Lurker69> me love my balls
[2013-01-14 04:48:00] <dyadic> I don't disagree really, but that's the issue I have with political discussion
[2013-01-14 04:48:07] <Cosmo_> I just hate when the people making speeches talk about 'empowring the people' when they talk about what we'd call 'civilised' countries.....No the people are already empowered and are fully capable at rising up against what they dislike, they'd just rather not.
[2013-01-14 04:48:23] <dyadic> in the end, everyone that agrees will still agree, and everyone that disagreed will still disagree
[2013-01-14 04:48:31] <Cosmo_> True
[2013-01-14 04:48:36] <dyadic> it's fruitless
[2013-01-14 04:50:08] <dyadic> it seems very rare to find times or people that can put their preconceptions aside for an honest discussion like that
[2013-01-14 04:50:38] <Cosmo_> You know if I could put one thing into place in the world
[2013-01-14 04:50:59] <Cosmo_> It'd be taking warning symbols off of the obvious things
[2013-01-14 04:51:06] <dyadic> haha
[2013-01-14 04:51:10] <Cosmo_> like "may contain nuts" on packets of peanuts
[2013-01-14 04:51:30] <dyadic> yeah, in the US they exist because of the overly-litigious nature of our society now
[2013-01-14 04:51:32] <Cosmo_> I mean obviously if something looks safe and isn't whack a sign on it
[2013-01-14 04:52:00] <Cosmo_> But if people are getting killed by this simple shit, I say it's darwinism doing it's thing.
[2013-01-14 04:52:05] <dyadic> companies do that shit to cover their ass from greedy jerks looking for a viable lawsuit
[2013-01-14 04:52:25] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: it's actually really nice to know that it's not possible to hurt yourself unless you work at it
[2013-01-14 04:52:40] <lulzorz> I mean, I disliked those labels for a long time
[2013-01-14 04:52:45] <lulzorz> and most of them are useless
[2013-01-14 04:53:17] <lulzorz> but if I'm not familiar with something, it's good to know that I won't die from screwing up as long as I pay attention to warnings
[2013-01-14 04:53:18] <Cosmo_> I'd also put into place a censoring system before any court case to sue someone. Just someone to look at it and decide if it's fucking dumb.
[2013-01-14 04:53:21] <dyadic> I particularly like the warnings on coffee cups:  'caution! hot!'
[2013-01-14 04:53:33] <dyadic> thank fuck my hot coffee is hot
[2013-01-14 04:53:46] <Cosmo_> Haha!! Exactly. But there's warnings, and then there's bubble-wrapping.
[2013-01-14 04:54:03] <dyadic> Cosmo_: you could never get that though...the courts make money off of the suits as well as anyone else does
[2013-01-14 04:54:04] <Cosmo_> If i'm in a laser cutting room, put warning on the fucking things so i know which end will hurt
[2013-01-14 04:54:17] <dyadic> the lawyers in the lawfirms lobby
[2013-01-14 04:54:18] <Cosmo_> I know, I'm talking about my own utopia. =P
[2013-01-14 04:54:21] <dyadic> ahh
[2013-01-14 04:54:33] <dyadic> well utopia is another word for 'that which cannot exist'
[2013-01-14 04:54:35] <lulzorz> yeah, but it's hard to draw the line...I've messed with equipment from unfamiliar fields before, and would have been pretty worried if it weren't for warnings EVERYWHERE
[2013-01-14 04:54:35] <dyadic> :)
[2013-01-14 04:54:41] <dyadic> literally
[2013-01-14 04:55:00] <Cosmo_> But at least my way creates more jobs ;)
[2013-01-14 04:55:32] <Cosmo_> It's nice to imagine.
[2013-01-14 04:56:28] <Cosmo_> Also, as touchy a subject as it may be, a central global government is a terrbile, terrible idea, so i don't know why people out in the area of the internet where this is normal topic of conversation keep bringing it up

[2013-01-14 05:02:21] <Cosmo_> I don't believe all governments today need to be overthrown and destroyed...... Because assuming a quick change would help anything is just intense optimism. I just think it's time to start making the changes to what we have to make way for changes in the future.... However i know that SOUNDS stupid and i really can't be bothered explaining everything I mean, so feel free to disagree outright =P
[2013-01-14 05:03:05] <dyadic> nah, that would be entangling myself in political discussion :p
[2013-01-14 05:03:28] <anonkush> do u guize thinnk there will be a revolution in the future where the freedom of anonymit will be fought over
[2013-01-14 05:03:50] <Cosmo_> A revolution? Yes, i believe in some cases it's beginning already
[2013-01-14 05:03:58] <dyadic> fought over, I doubt it
[2013-01-14 05:04:01] <Cosmo_> Whether it happens on the world stage, it's hard to say.
[2013-01-14 05:04:13] <anonkush> the internet is changing things
[2013-01-14 05:04:39] <dyadic> there will be more high-profile media coverage of horrific events to scare people, followed by legislation and more acquiescence
[2013-01-14 05:04:43] <dyadic> that's how ppl work
[2013-01-14 05:04:46] <dyadic> they easy
[2013-01-14 05:05:14] <anonkush> people are becoming more aware (not all but a few). Information is the greatest threat to our plutocracy
[2013-01-14 05:05:24] <Cosmo_> It is. Now here's what i think.... People don't fear anonymity, it exists in other cases. People fear someone anonymously breaking the law and getting away with it.
[2013-01-14 05:05:42] <dyadic> loose a lion into the masses
[2013-01-14 05:05:44] <Cosmo_> And anonymous 'parties' starting something uncontrollable.
[2013-01-14 05:06:19] <Cosmo_> Now I get that, I don't want my shit stolen, or group attacks arranged or any other 'crazy' stuff that are the only things we ever hear about.
[2013-01-14 05:06:33] <anonkush> go on
[2013-01-14 05:07:20] <Cosmo_> But doesn't that mean we need two things in place. 1) a set of laws (That in this case CAN be global to a degree) relating only to 'cyber' communities. Laws that apply to public AND anonymous communities
[2013-01-14 05:07:23] <anonkush> are u saying people are willing to sacrifice their privacy in exchange that their privacy does not get stolen?
[2013-01-14 05:07:53] <Cosmo_> and 2) an online 'warrant' system.
[2013-01-14 05:08:07] <Cosmo_> I don't think people should have to.
[2013-01-14 05:08:17] <dyadic> the only way you could maintain such a system was to get people to realize:  bad shit happens, there will always be bad people.  oh fucking well
[2013-01-14 05:08:41] <lulzorz> the false privacy/security tradeoff is the central thing here
[2013-01-14 05:08:42] <Cosmo_> Yes. But the problem there is getting them to think outside their bubble.
[2013-01-14 05:08:44] <anonkush> Cosmo the only way there could a be broad concensus among govnts of what the internet should be is if there is a one world govn
[2013-01-14 05:09:00] <Cosmo_> Or one internet government.... hahaa!
[2013-01-14 05:09:05] |<-- zebra has left freenode (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[2013-01-14 05:09:07] <lulzorz> and if 9/11 wasn't a false flag, the USA govt reacted to it like it was
[2013-01-14 05:09:23] <zeke> hi lurke69.  Sorry, I was sidetracked.
[2013-01-14 05:09:26] <Cosmo_> Imagine that, a government that only has power online, nowhere else.....
[2013-01-14 05:09:42] <anonkush> well we have the currency -bitcoin
[2013-01-14 05:09:43] <Cosmo_> Completely unrealistic, I know, but it'd be crazy
[2013-01-14 05:10:22] <dyadic> why would you want to give a government control of the largest stream of information in existence
[2013-01-14 05:10:23] <Cosmo_> True. But then you have the problem. say that government becomes made up entirely of people from...say...europe. They will only make changes benefitting europe.
[2013-01-14 05:10:26] <anonkush> it could be realistic if the internet turned into virtual reality internet
[2013-01-14 05:10:27] <dyadic> that'd be awful
[2013-01-14 05:11:00] <Cosmo_> Before the internet the largest stream of information was.....well....everything else.
[2013-01-14 05:11:02] <anonkush> the virtual internet
[2013-01-14 05:11:25] <anonkush> before internet there was nothing but the voidness
[2013-01-14 05:11:38] <Cosmo_> ....others called them "books"....
[2013-01-14 05:11:38] <zeke> I always love when these discussions crop up and "the gubmint" is some other entity and not comprised of the people
[2013-01-14 05:11:45] <dyadic> Cosmo_: much of what has made the internet good, is that it is largely anarchic
[2013-01-14 05:11:48] <dyadic> no rulers
[2013-01-14 05:12:10] <anonkush> i will tell stories to my children of a world before internet and they will either be amazed or horrified
[2013-01-14 05:12:19] <dyadic> people cooperatively work together voluntarily, and when someone doesn't, people stop working with them
[2013-01-14 05:12:27] <zeke> It's not a thing, it's us.  What remains is a majority rediscovering that.
[2013-01-14 05:12:49] <dyadic> eh
[2013-01-14 05:12:49] <zeke> I suppose the same argument applies to the Internet
[2013-01-14 05:12:56] <Cosmo_> zeke: I mentioned that earlier. We are capable of doing so much but people rather....wouldn't
[2013-01-14 05:12:59] <lulzorz> zeke: that hasn't been true in the USA at any point in the past 200 years
[2013-01-14 05:13:17] <lulzorz> the fed taking over was the point of no return
[2013-01-14 05:13:22] <zeke> absolutely.  sheeple are too busy watching stupid television shows
[2013-01-14 05:13:38] -->| Cooper5 (41ffb5f4@gateway/web/freenode/ip.65.255.181.244) has joined #33012013
[2013-01-14 05:13:57] <Cosmo_> Alright i have a question for all you guys
[2013-01-14 05:14:04] <zeke> Online, i think, is different.  here we have a two way medium, research at our fingertips and an ability to form very dynamic groups
[2013-01-14 05:14:05] <anonkush> i think what the gov should do is give a laptop to every child in america, make education online, stop sending kids to school...
[2013-01-14 05:14:11] <lulzorz> USA govt is always in debt to the fed, "the borrower is slave to the lender", and we are an asset of the rothschild family
[2013-01-14 05:14:59] <zeke> anonkush, i like it, but what are all these two parents working families to do during the day??
[2013-01-14 05:15:03] <lulzorz> anonkush: and they'll all have screen recording and content blocking to Protect the Children of course
[2013-01-14 05:15:21] <Cosmo_> Say all laws and all censorship are frozen and sharing information is free, anonymity is possible. there's your situation. Say a group of people join together anonymously and begin something that results int he deaths of say.....5 people.
[2013-01-14 05:15:23] <anonkush> hmmm good point zeke damn it
[2013-01-14 05:15:54] <Cosmo_> Now assuming you guys still believe murder should be illegal (i hope)
[2013-01-14 05:16:01] <Cosmo_> what do we do about those deaths?
[2013-01-14 05:16:01] <lulzorz> and by the time the kid graduates, the company providing the boxen will have a nice profile of everyone to sell to advertisers
[2013-01-14 05:16:09] <zeke> lulzorz, I don't care if someone else is in debt.  that's their's to fix.  if I am in the + and stable/resource independent isn't that enough?
[2013-01-14 05:16:28] <lulzorz> zeke: but the government is all of us
[2013-01-14 05:16:56] <zeke> there's already laws on books regarding murder.  that's what we do
[2013-01-14 05:16:59] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: people go out in the woods to not be overheard, cryptocat is no different
[2013-01-14 05:17:52] <Cosmo_> But as it stands people can be held responsible.
[2013-01-14 05:18:01] <anonkush> well, internet education should def be taught, the way is impacting society. Class vocabulary will consist of memes, piracy, internet bullying, and porn
[2013-01-14 05:18:17] <zeke> true.  individually and collectively.  so I lobby, to everyone i talk to.  get debt free, educate yourself on independent living and be a little humble
[2013-01-14 05:18:27] <lulzorz> anonkush: internet can teach itself, no reason to cover in school
[2013-01-14 05:18:51] <Cosmo_> Oh yeah, what do you guys think of adult security? Like parents limiting a childs laptop on what they can see?
[2013-01-14 05:18:53] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: I don't see how it's a significant difference...
[2013-01-14 05:18:57] <Cosmo_> Personally I'm for it.
[2013-01-14 05:19:00] <dyadic> internet bullying not a thing
[2013-01-14 05:19:10] <zeke> once we get children past reading, writing and basic math, they are self sufficient.  everything else is indoctrination.
[2013-01-14 05:19:19] <dyadic> Cosmo_: up to the parents
[2013-01-14 05:19:37] <zeke> we still have public libraries, right?  and free, mostly ubiquitous, internet.

[2013-01-14 05:19:43] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: personally, I'd say fuck that...I grew up on unrestricted internet and it worked out fine
[2013-01-14 05:20:14] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: being able to talk to friends without parents overhearing is hella fucking important, it always has been
[2013-01-14 05:20:35] <Cosmo_> lulzorz: I don't mean them SPYING on you, i just mean them limiting specific sites
[2013-01-14 05:21:08] <Cosmo_> What could be considered 'dangerous' or 'damaging' sites to children.
[2013-01-14 05:21:26] <zeke> cosmo, you mean besides /b?  ;)
[2013-01-14 05:21:31] <anonkush> 4chan
[2013-01-14 05:21:43] <anonkush> :D
[2013-01-14 05:21:47] <Cosmo_> Not social networking sites.
[2013-01-14 05:21:55] <lulzorz> I found 4chan at 12 after it was referenced on xkcd
[2013-01-14 05:22:02] <Cosmo_> Hahaha! yeah 4chan MAY be an example ;)
[2013-01-14 05:22:14] <lulzorz> I don't see any problem with it...
[2013-01-14 05:22:41] <anonkush> 4chan is the epitome of internet indecency
[2013-01-14 05:22:48] <Cosmo_> I think the fact I work with kids (paedophiles jokes away if you must) I have a different opinion on it.
[2013-01-14 05:22:54] <anonkush> lol
[2013-01-14 05:23:24] <zeke> the only problem i see is getting too much of it.  despite an amazing online world, we still live with bricks and mortar.  where and how do young people train for that anymore?
[2013-01-14 05:23:34] <Cosmo_> Kids are honestly so dumb. I worked woth the police teaching e-safety to 11 year olds..... Seriously they were so stupid i thought they were joking.
[2013-01-14 05:23:51] <lulzorz> plus, there is no way to block anything
[2013-01-14 05:23:57] <Cosmo_> like dyadic said, i guess it's down to the parents.
[2013-01-14 05:24:00] <lulzorz> unless you don't allow a single byte of traffic you can't identify
[2013-01-14 05:24:31] <anonkush> that will teach kids to circumvent porn
[2013-01-14 05:24:39] <lulzorz> 12 year old me could have figured this out even if his parents did try to restrict him
[2013-01-14 05:24:45] <lulzorz> and in fact used proxies and tor for fun
[2013-01-14 05:25:15] <Cosmo_> 12 year old me had to, my dad was one of those fuckers who worked with computers.
[2013-01-14 05:25:22] <lulzorz> anonkush: which, considering the way things are going with government blocks, is an incredibly useful skill
[2013-01-14 05:25:27] <anonkush> What's TOR?
[2013-01-14 05:25:38] <Cosmo_> ^tarantulas on radar"
[2013-01-14 05:25:43] <zeke> I taught in a middle school and then high school for a while.  90+% of them were so dumb.  the remaining kids were very sharp with tech.
[2013-01-14 05:25:46] =-= anonkush is now known as father
[2013-01-14 05:25:53] <lulzorz> anonkush: that thing with the pedos and internet criminals
[2013-01-14 05:25:56] <father> What's TOR :D?
[2013-01-14 05:26:02] <Cosmo_> Nice try ;)
[2013-01-14 05:26:09] =-= father is now known as anonkush
[2013-01-14 05:26:17] <Cosmo_> Tony's Oral Rating
[2013-01-14 05:26:22] <Cosmo_> Google is your friend bro
[2013-01-14 05:26:24] <anonkush> yea iknow tor
[2013-01-14 05:26:26] <lulzorz> father: oh, it's a research network
[2013-01-14 05:26:58] <zeke> Temporarily outside resistance
[2013-01-14 05:27:18] <Cosmo_> totalitarian orang-utans reading.
[2013-01-14 05:27:46] <Cosmo_> I do worry about the next generation....
[2013-01-14 05:28:01] <anonkush> why Cosmo?
[2013-01-14 05:28:03] <Cosmo_> I mean... internet censorship, laws everything like that aside
[2013-01-14 05:28:29] <Cosmo_> I PERSONALLY (so again feel free to shoot me down) think it's scary how much time they'll spend on computers
[2013-01-14 05:29:16] <lulzorz> I spent a whole buttload of time on my box when I was a young teen
[2013-01-14 05:29:19] <anonkush> privacy will be the omst precious commodity
[2013-01-14 05:29:39] <lulzorz> and then discovered that the skills I learned could be used to make $$$ with almost no effort
[2013-01-14 05:29:49] <Cosmo_> But i assume when you were at school that was away from your computer.
[2013-01-14 05:30:10] <Cosmo_> But today there's computers in schools, internet on phones, then laptops when they're home
[2013-01-14 05:30:16] <--| nadando has left #33012013
[2013-01-14 05:30:20] <anonkush> and xbox
[2013-01-14 05:30:20] <Cosmo_> They are never 'disconnected'
[2013-01-14 05:30:23] <lulzorz> I grew up outside the school system, actually...
[2013-01-14 05:30:48] <Cosmo_> But you had a social life that involved going outside at some point, surely?
[2013-01-14 05:30:50] <zeke> lulzorz, you are that 1%
[2013-01-14 05:30:58] <Cosmo_> I mean i see a room of kids today
[2013-01-14 05:31:04] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: not really, no...
[2013-01-14 05:31:10] <Cosmo_> instead of talking to EACHOTHER they were all on facebook on their phone.
[2013-01-14 05:31:40] <Cosmo_> lulzorz, I can't imagine it. Sometimes I just need to talk to a person. In real life.
[2013-01-14 05:32:04] <lulzorz> but I don't have a phone, so that makes me more like 0.1%
[2013-01-14 05:32:14] <Cosmo_> But then growing up with 3 older (very loud) siblings forced me that way.
[2013-01-14 05:32:19] <zeke> the talking online part is cool.  some of my high schoolers had friends all over the world they had never met irl
[2013-01-14 05:32:37] <lulzorz> zeke: and now you do, too!
[2013-01-14 05:32:44] <zeke> :)
[2013-01-14 05:32:49] <Cosmo_> I do that too, it's great!
[2013-01-14 05:33:04] <Cosmo_> I'm just more worried about the loss of social skills....
[2013-01-14 05:33:12] <lulzorz> it is really fucking weird shooting the shit with complete strangers
[2013-01-14 05:33:25] <zeke> my biggest worry is the lack of learning real world skills that shore up the real world
[2013-01-14 05:33:37] <Cosmo_> Yep.
[2013-01-14 05:33:42] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: my social skills certainly suffered, but boy scouts pretty much fixed that
[2013-01-14 05:33:57] <Cosmo_> I was about to say, you don't seem to be struggling here.
[2013-01-14 05:34:09] <zeke> one can stay so busy getting nothing done with social networking and distraction internet
[2013-01-14 05:34:23] <Cosmo_> [hand up] uni student. Guilty.
[2013-01-14 05:34:25] <lulzorz> zeke: all day erryday
[2013-01-14 05:34:35] <absolutezeroff> I've had OL friends since I was 11
[2013-01-14 05:34:41] <absolutezeroff> granted when i was 11 i was the really immature one
[2013-01-14 05:35:30] <absolutezeroff> er back in 10-20
[2013-01-14 05:35:33] |<-- absolutezeroff has left freenode (Quit: Lost terminal)
[2013-01-14 05:36:04] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: social skills IRL are totally different from here
[2013-01-14 05:36:21] <lulzorz> but FB is the worst
[2013-01-14 05:36:35] <Cosmo_> There are SOME transferable skills. Man i use fb for maybe.... 3 things?
[2013-01-14 05:36:47] <lulzorz> I just have no freaking clue when I'm supposed to talk
[2013-01-14 05:36:57] <zeke> true.  the body language, facial tells, etc are not to be had online.
[2013-01-14 05:37:01] <Cosmo_> My coursemates have a page that's good for coursework....birthdays....
[2013-01-14 05:37:14] <lulzorz> zeke: I'm really, really bad at body language...but movies help
[2013-01-14 05:37:21] <Cosmo_> zeke: And strangely though a lot of my life is online those are something of a speciality of mine.
[2013-01-14 05:37:32] <dyadic> have never had facebook, myspace, etc.
[2013-01-14 05:37:51] <zeke> very cool cosmo.
[2013-01-14 05:37:51] <lulzorz> oh, and aggressive jackasses are something I simply don't have a way to handle
[2013-01-14 05:37:57] <Cosmo_> myspace...oh god those were the days
[2013-01-14 05:38:06] <Cosmo_> I was in a band....for like....5 years....
[2013-01-14 05:38:11] <zeke> i don't think the issue is too much time online, it's what one does with it
[2013-01-14 05:38:13] <dyadic> I've never signed up for any social network :x
[2013-01-14 05:38:27] <lulzorz> dyadic: you liar, you're using one right now
[2013-01-14 05:38:30] <dyadic> irc, email, jabber
[2013-01-14 05:38:47] <dyadic> I don't consider irc to be a Social Network in the sense that the term is used
[2013-01-14 05:38:48] <Cosmo_> facebook ITSELF is not bad, but peoples obsession with it....eurgh
[2013-01-14 05:38:57] <dyadic> facebook is kind of bad
[2013-01-14 05:39:10] <lulzorz> fb is bad indeed
[2013-01-14 05:39:21] <Cosmo_> Although, people spend all their time on there because they're scared they'll miss something or be out of the loop.....But that's why I'm here so much =P
[2013-01-14 05:39:22] <lulzorz> I can just go and buy private profile info
[2013-01-14 05:39:26] <lulzorz> wholesale
[2013-01-14 05:39:31] <dyadic> yup
[2013-01-14 05:39:33] <zeke> FB is inane
[2013-01-14 05:39:56] <dyadic> the constant phone texting thing is really annoying to observe, to me
[2013-01-14 05:40:01] <anonkush> http://rledev.mit.edu/aaron.html
[2013-01-14 05:40:09] <dyadic> the appeal of it is completely lost on me
[2013-01-14 05:40:30] <Cosmo_> Oh it's so shit. Google 'nokia 100' i got me one of those bad boys, pay-as-you-go, never had an issue
[2013-01-14 05:40:31] <dyadic> and as far as profiling, it's worse than facebook
[2013-01-14 05:40:50] <lulzorz> dyadic: if I'm talking to someone and they're suddenly on their phone, I have a tendency to just say fuck it and walk away
[2013-01-14 05:41:01] <dyadic> haha
[2013-01-14 05:41:16] <dyadic> I luckily don't have that happen much, but I mean even people I'm not talking to
[2013-01-14 05:41:23] <lulzorz> yeah
[2013-01-14 05:41:30] <lulzorz> it's rare...but it pisses me off
[2013-01-14 05:41:31] <dyadic> just seeing some jackass walking mindlessly, fixated on their stupid smartphone
[2013-01-14 05:41:52] <dyadic> smartphones are nice tech but fuck, look up once in a while
[2013-01-14 05:41:55] |<-- vujalov has left freenode (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-01-14 05:41:58] <Cosmo_> Fucking...smartphones.
[2013-01-14 05:42:09] <Cosmo_> I admire them....i mean the phones themselves.
[2013-01-14 05:42:18] <Cosmo_> But why did we make it possible for idiots to be armed with them?
[2013-01-14 05:42:26] <dyadic> expensive life cataloging devices
[2013-01-14 05:43:03] <dyadic> I like getting the ads on pandora that are relevant to where I am geographically
[2013-01-14 05:43:06] <dyadic> spooky as fuck
[2013-01-14 05:43:25] <lulzorz> anonkush: of course, they're using IIS+coldfusion
[2013-01-14 05:43:53] <Cosmo_> Alright, so we know what we all hate.... But what would we actually DO about it? I mean say you have the power and resources, what would you do?
[2013-01-14 05:43:59] <dyadic> lol are they?? iis??
[2013-01-14 05:44:00] <anonkush> didn't the cicada use the same servers/
[2013-01-14 05:44:03] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: access to a lot of tech should be IQ-test-based
[2013-01-14 05:44:18] <dyadic> nah
[2013-01-14 05:44:25] <lulzorz> anonkush: bitch please, 3301 is running apache
[2013-01-14 05:44:45] <lulzorz> of course, all the kool kids run nginx these days
[2013-01-14 05:44:51] <dyadic> are they?  I wondered whether that was bogus
[2013-01-14 05:45:13] <iIIustrious> It sure claims to be apache
[2013-01-14 05:45:17] <dyadic> yes
[2013-01-14 05:45:33] <zeke> cosmo, maybe i'm a cynic, but i just give up the whole change it, rescue it mentality.
[2013-01-14 05:45:35] <dyadic> my scripts claim to be mozilla, too
[2013-01-14 05:45:47] <lulzorz> iIIustrious: not really any reason to not be apache but claim you are...
[2013-01-14 05:46:21] <iIIustrious> especially when it's most likely oour only current lead on onion2v2
[2013-01-14 05:46:28] <Cosmo_> zeke: I know. But we can identify the problems, who can't? You guys are skilled mentally, so what would you DO?
[2013-01-14 05:47:37] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: depends on the problems...USA capitalism is pretty much good the way it is
[2013-01-14 05:47:57] <lulzorz> I mean, it has a bunch of issues
[2013-01-14 05:48:06] <Cosmo_> I mean online. Consider the skills you have, then work out what you would do if the limits were taken away.
[2013-01-14 05:48:07] <lulzorz> but they got so many things right
[2013-01-14 05:48:47] <zeke> fair enough.  I suppose the best way to steer the ship is by offering better advertising in the marketplace of ideas
[2013-01-14 05:49:02] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: the biggest limit is that dumbasses use windows because they don't know any better
[2013-01-14 05:49:19] <lulzorz> and then you get people like "how do I shot telnet?"
[2013-01-14 05:49:49] <Cosmo_> Is that really such a huge issue for you? For all of us?
[2013-01-14 05:49:52] <zeke> i like what ladyada is doing now with the electronics cartoons and plush figures.  the young are a blank slate and it's easy to make it cool for them
[2013-01-14 05:50:05] <lulzorz> "I want something that just works" = "I want to use the most complex thing humanity has ever created without spending any time at all learning how"
[2013-01-14 05:50:55] <Cosmo_> Well let's narrow down on what you're saying. What would you say to technophobes who simply want to stay in touch with their family?
[2013-01-14 05:51:16] <lulzorz> new rule: if you don't know how something works, you aren't allowed to make laws about it
[2013-01-14 05:51:47] <zeke> lulzorz, i like it.  you've got to learn to play classical before you should attempt jazz
[2013-01-14 05:52:07] <Cosmo_> ^As a musician i am so offended by this i might have to punch a child...^
[2013-01-14 05:52:12] <dyadic> zeke: why?  original jazz musicians were not classically trained
[2013-01-14 05:52:18] <zeke> lol.  it's a metaphor
[2013-01-14 05:52:25] |<-- anonkush has left freenode (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[2013-01-14 05:52:25] <Cosmo_> zeke: terrible, terrible metaphor bro ;)
[2013-01-14 05:52:27] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: don't come running to me when you break shit
[2013-01-14 05:52:28] <dyadic> I know, I'm saying it's a bad one :P
[2013-01-14 05:52:38] <zeke> dang  dog, all i'm saying is mastery of the rules makes for flexibility in warping them
[2013-01-14 05:52:58] <lulzorz> it's your computer, you bought it and paid for it, learn how to fix it yourself
[2013-01-14 05:53:06] <dyadic> basically, no more lobbying with monies
[2013-01-14 05:53:08] <Cosmo_> lulzorz: ezpanding eliteism is not an answer. I take my car to a mechanic
[2013-01-14 05:53:13] <dyadic> would be a good rule
[2013-01-14 05:53:26] <lulzorz> dyadic: that is the first thing that needs to change
[2013-01-14 05:53:36] <zeke> me too cosmo.  there's only so much time in the day
[2013-01-14 05:53:50] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: but most car owners can change their oil, at least
[2013-01-14 05:54:07] <zeke> i'd love to learn more about so many things, but that leads to being a dilletante
[2013-01-14 05:54:21] <Cosmo_> And most computer owners can remove a virus. But car mechanics goes much, MUCH further, as with a computer
[2013-01-14 05:54:45] <zeke> isn't it better to specialize a little bit, not be a dick, and share knowledge with chosen communities offering their own specialties?
[2013-01-14 05:55:09] <lulzorz> lol, viruses...they should never have existed
[2013-01-14 05:55:23] <dyadic> why not
[2013-01-14 05:55:30] <Cosmo_> lulzorz, do you believe in sharing knowledge? Because maybe you could be the one to TEACH these people about their computers =P
[2013-01-14 05:55:43] <dyadic> knowledge is a commodity
[2013-01-14 05:55:49] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: who taught me?
[2013-01-14 05:55:55] <lulzorz> I taught me, that's who
[2013-01-14 05:56:01] <lulzorz> no reason anyone can't teach themselves
[2013-01-14 05:56:13] <Cosmo_> give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day, teach a man to fish he'll eat for life
[2013-01-14 05:56:26] <Cosmo_> some people (call them mere mortals) don't know HOW to teach themselves
[2013-01-14 05:56:37] <dyadic> get paid to teach a man to fish and he will value what you teach, and you will get soemthing out of it
[2013-01-14 05:56:40] <Cosmo_> Give them a pointer that is literally the basis for development of community
[2013-01-14 05:56:41] <dyadic> :P
[2013-01-14 05:56:49] <Cosmo_> dyadic: Well played
[2013-01-14 05:56:51] <zeke> lulzorz there's only so much time in a day.  i mean come on, there are post grad degrees being offered now in using gps software

[2013-01-14 05:57:51] <Cosmo_> buahaha! Messing with you man
[2013-01-14 05:57:52] <lulzorz> so there's this new thing called a search engine...
[2013-01-14 05:57:59] <zeke> sure, i'm all for the hotrod, git r dun, mentality.  hacking and self education is awesome.
[2013-01-14 05:58:17] <Lurker69> http://rledev.mit.edu/aaron.html  wow guys this is gold
[2013-01-14 05:58:28] <Lurker69> bloody gold but anyyway
[2013-01-14 05:58:40] <lulzorz> Lurker69: yeah, we were talking about that...consensus was that they were asking for it, what with IIS+coldfusion
[2013-01-14 05:58:56] <lulzorz> people don't even know what https is
[2013-01-14 05:58:59] <lulzorz> fucking https
[2013-01-14 05:59:12] <lulzorz> I have to explain by saying "that thing with the padlock icon"
[2013-01-14 05:59:31] <Lurker69> i am glad that my /b/ thread yesterday become at least semi popular
[2013-01-14 05:59:48] <Lurker69> i didnt read anything about techincal view of his downloading yet
[2013-01-14 05:59:50] <dyadic> next most important thing on innernuts agenda:  fucking fix the bullshit broken central cert authority problem
[2013-01-14 05:59:54] <dyadic> fuck a duck
[2013-01-14 06:00:06] <dyadic> of all fucking things, that is so hugely a problem
[2013-01-14 06:00:34] <Lurker69> but yeah i hope he didnt die for nothing, maybe things will change
[2013-01-14 06:00:40] <lulzorz> dyadic: that's nowhere close to top priority
[2013-01-14 06:00:43] <Cosmo_> I don't know as much as you about all the stuff that's been done here lulzorz, but i know a fuck-ton about the history of music, a sound desk, and psycho-acoustics.... Because that's what i taught myself, and the field i moved into. We HAVE to allow stupid people, as much as it pains me to admit.
[2013-01-14 06:00:51] <lulzorz> it should be, but we're talking cryptodumbass terms here
[2013-01-14 06:00:56] <dyadic> lulzorz: it's pretty high, ffs
[2013-01-14 06:01:00] <dyadic> oh
[2013-01-14 06:01:05] <dyadic> you mean to most people
[2013-01-14 06:01:09] <dyadic> yeah
[2013-01-14 06:01:19] <lulzorz> there are a bunch of solutions to that
[2013-01-14 06:01:26] <dyadic> yes
[2013-01-14 06:01:27] <lulzorz> but none of them will work
[2013-01-14 06:01:47] <lulzorz> it's not a proof, but it derives from zooko's triangle
[2013-01-14 06:02:07] <lulzorz> which hasn't really been broken
[2013-01-14 06:02:44] <lulzorz> Lurker69: also, anon hacking my homepage after I die would make my life complete
[2013-01-14 06:03:27] <lulzorz> but the top issue here is that dumbasses don't know how to keep themselves safe
[2013-01-14 06:03:29] <Cosmo_> Gotta do something great for that =P
[2013-01-14 06:04:00] <lulzorz> once 50% of emails have PGP sigs, we can start worrying about global x.509
[2013-01-14 06:04:04] <Cosmo_> Yeah. So much  money goes into 'web security'....it'd be so much faster to just people to not be fucking dumb.
[2013-01-14 06:04:29] <Cosmo_> *teach
[2013-01-14 06:04:53] <lulzorz> on the other hand, drug monkeys haven't had too much trouble adjusting to tor sites
[2013-01-14 06:05:13] <zeke> that's true.  but most people have neither the skills, intellect nor drive to find out.  that is the sentinels jobs.
[2013-01-14 06:05:17] <rr645> EMS here. The dumbass runs deep. If we can't teach people to be smart IRL, what hope for the internet...
[2013-01-14 06:05:29] <zeke> by that i mean the smart, non dickish, folks on the frontier.
[2013-01-14 06:06:01] <zeke> here's a thought.  make it fun.  people love to be  entertained.
[2013-01-14 06:06:02] <lulzorz> most of the top people are dickish to dumbasses who bug them while they're trying to work
[2013-01-14 06:06:34] <zeke> look at the things cicada is teaching us, or at least involving us in.  (for me it's been huge for learning)
[2013-01-14 06:07:04] <zeke> lulzorz i can be too.
[2013-01-14 06:07:13] <Cosmo_> The fact is, compared to you guys i am RETARDED with this stuff. But being here has forced me to go and find otu what the fuck you're doing. I've learnt a lot.
[2013-01-14 06:07:14] <lulzorz> end of last year had people making PGP keys
[2013-01-14 06:07:18] <rr645> That's succeeding this year in a way it didn't at all last year. There wouldn't have been any shared code before--too much paranoia
[2013-01-14 06:07:42] <lulzorz> rr645: those were fun days though, I hope we get them back this year
[2013-01-14 06:07:53] <zeke> i don't
[2013-01-14 06:08:09] <zeke> frankly i think the point of cicada this year is to team up.\
[2013-01-14 06:08:26] <lulzorz> I guess it's different from my perspective...I'm relatively confident I can get through most of this alone
[2013-01-14 06:08:28] <rr645> Zeke, they weren't that bad. I'm technically incompetent and yet I still managed to join a decent group because I was level-headed and polite.
[2013-01-14 06:08:36] <lulzorz> (that being said, I'm totally out of ideas right now)
[2013-01-14 06:09:08] <zeke> i'm sure can.  it would make you ideally positioned to act as tribal elder so to speak.
[2013-01-14 06:09:27] <lulzorz> individual groups were fun because you get to troll the fuck out of each other
[2013-01-14 06:09:32] <Cosmo_> I've just been educating myself on as much as i can. I spent today learning about crowley....first to find something relevant, then because he's morbidly fascinating.
[2013-01-14 06:09:33] <zeke> i'm sure i'm not alone in thinking that cacada has been monitoring all this
[2013-01-14 06:09:46] <lulzorz> seriously, some of the trolling was more entertaining than the main puzzle
[2013-01-14 06:09:47] <rr645> lulzorz: Certainly.
[2013-01-14 06:10:16] <Cosmo_> Cicada probably has.
[2013-01-14 06:11:23] <Cosmo_> I've always wanted to MAKE a search like this... a trial of sorts, but involving EVERYTHING. not just coding, i mean history, philosophy, engineering, psychology...
[2013-01-14 06:11:42] <Cosmo_> I've just nothing to offer anyone if they finish =P
[2013-01-14 06:11:45] <dyadic> running, biking, swimming, shooting
[2013-01-14 06:11:49] <zeke> to answer your earlier question Cosmo, here's one.  a real easy stego interface for the masses.  lets call it stegasaurus.  the schtick can be grandkids sending hidden messages to their grandparents in family pictures
[2013-01-14 06:12:12] <Cosmo_> horse-riding, telekinesis, midget-throwing....
[2013-01-14 06:12:22] <dyadic> skiing, competitive eating
[2013-01-14 06:12:27] <zeke> lmao.
[2013-01-14 06:12:38] <Cosmo_> zeke: That's a good idea... I'd use it! haha!
[2013-01-14 06:12:39] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: if you win this one, maybe cicada will help you :p
[2013-01-14 06:12:49] <zeke> and someone should.
[2013-01-14 06:13:28] <Cosmo_> Hahaha!! Me win this? Good christ, no chance. I'm here for two reasons only. 1) To put the spare time before uni starts into learning something and 2) in the hope that i inadvertantly find something that helps someone like you solve it
[2013-01-14 06:13:37] <zeke> i lack the compenence to code such a thing.  i'm not too proud to admit it.  that doesn't mean it shouldn't be made.  again we're back to ream
[2013-01-14 06:14:09] <zeke> cosmo, i am so there with your last comment
[2013-01-14 06:14:13] <lulzorz> zeke: a simple idiot-proof gui for outguess would do it
[2013-01-14 06:14:18] <zeke> team, btw, not ream.  sheesh
[2013-01-14 06:14:24] <Cosmo_> Well i suck at coding, but i know people that aren't and I'm a hell of a salesman, I could sell the idea to someone ELSE ;)
[2013-01-14 06:14:51] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: lrn2code
[2013-01-14 06:14:55] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: seriously, it's not that hard
[2013-01-14 06:15:13] <lulzorz> windows makes it hard, though
[2013-01-14 06:15:19] <Cosmo_> lulzorz, I AM learning, I promise. Coming here gave me the drive to want to
[2013-01-14 06:15:23] <dyadic> if you can get past the tedium, it's usually worth it
[2013-01-14 06:15:23] <zeke> lulzorz.  let's say i'm a noos.  where would you suggest i start?
[2013-01-14 06:15:28] <zeke> noob
[2013-01-14 06:15:28] <Cosmo_> Well right now I've not got much choice.
[2013-01-14 06:15:35] <lulzorz> zeke: python, runs fine on windows even
[2013-01-14 06:15:42] <lulzorz> just start doing random shit in python
[2013-01-14 06:15:55] <lulzorz> write a chat program, screw around with files, whatever
[2013-01-14 06:15:57] <Cosmo_> i've done quite a bit of python and a fuck-ton of C (as part of my course)
[2013-01-14 06:15:59] <zeke> i program machines by day.  cnc.  so i get logic, sub routines etc
[2013-01-14 06:16:09] <lulzorz> but you're going to need to switch to linux at some point
[2013-01-14 06:16:10] <dyadic> Cosmo_: what are you studying
[2013-01-14 06:16:12] <zeke> i am running ubuntu.
[2013-01-14 06:16:24] <Cosmo_> Audio & Music Technology.
[2013-01-14 06:16:29] <dyadic> nice
[2013-01-14 06:16:39] <Cosmo_> But we design our own echo plug-ins and stuff.
[2013-01-14 06:16:41] <lulzorz> zeke: all right then, you're gonna do fine...start with C as soon as you can
[2013-01-14 06:16:42] <iIIustrious> if you've got the head for it, I advise jumping into c or something more like it than python, you'll learn what all you're doing means faster
[2013-01-14 06:17:02] <zeke> any good books to follow? o'reilly?
[2013-01-14 06:17:03] <lulzorz> zeke: personally, I read a C book pretty much cover to cover, so by the time I actually sat down and wrote some code, it was glorious
[2013-01-14 06:17:15] <dyadic> zeke: k&r, the standard
[2013-01-14 06:17:21] <dyadic> it's old as fuck tho
[2013-01-14 06:17:37] <lulzorz> zeke: I have an old book titled "C programming" by steve worthington
[2013-01-14 06:17:40] <dyadic> after k&r, SICP
[2013-01-14 06:17:51] <iIIustrious> heh, I started with an old berkely c book
[2013-01-14 06:18:03] <dyadic> or perhaps SICP first, depending on how you think
[2013-01-14 06:18:09] <lulzorz> but that's the only programming book I've messed with
[2013-01-14 06:18:11] <Lurker69> http://images.4chan.org/sci/src/1357952229368.jpg  proportionality
[2013-01-14 06:18:13] <Cosmo_> I couldn't afford the C book from uni. Apparently i wasn't the only one because it was NEVER in the library....
[2013-01-14 06:18:19] <lulzorz> other languages are better done by example
[2013-01-14 06:18:32] <lulzorz> >can't afford book
[2013-01-14 06:18:37] <lulzorz> you're clearly doing something wrong

[2013-01-14 06:18:56] <zeke> looks like i can get worthington for 1c on amazon.  nice
[2013-01-14 06:18:56] <dyadic> zeke: http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/
[2013-01-14 06:19:03] <dyadic> sicp uses Scheme
[2013-01-14 06:19:03] <lulzorz> if you want a book and can't get it, there's a serious problem with society
[2013-01-14 06:19:09] <dyadic> but it doesn't really matter what you learn
[2013-01-14 06:19:17] <lulzorz> zeke: no idea whether it's a good book or not, but it did it for me
[2013-01-14 06:19:24] <Cosmo_> Well it WOULD be free from the library but they didn't have enough copies
[2013-01-14 06:19:26] <dyadic> what language, once you know one from each paradigm roughly
[2013-01-14 06:19:42] <lulzorz> C is good to start with if you can wrap your head around it
[2013-01-14 06:19:51] <zeke> thank you all so much for your input on this.
[2013-01-14 06:20:02] <lulzorz> and the syntax really isn't that bad
[2013-01-14 06:20:04] <dyadic> SICP is good if you want to learn actual computer science
[2013-01-14 06:20:08] <lulzorz> but you need to understand how computers work
[2013-01-14 06:20:13] <dyadic> and not only 'coding'
[2013-01-14 06:20:25] <dyadic> but C is important to know
[2013-01-14 06:20:30] <dyadic> and ubiquitous
[2013-01-14 06:20:46] <lulzorz> you can just go and compile C and run it on anything
[2013-01-14 06:20:47] <dyadic> and so much shit uses c style structured programming
[2013-01-14 06:20:55] <dyadic> yeah
[2013-01-14 06:21:01] <lulzorz> of course, MS did the very best they could to fuck things up
[2013-01-14 06:21:06] <Cosmo_> I have to say C has helped me understand a LOT.
[2013-01-14 06:21:07] <rr645> Arduino code is based on C, isn't it?
[2013-01-14 06:21:08] <lulzorz> since that's just part of their business model
[2013-01-14 06:21:17] <lulzorz> rr645: yeah

[2013-01-14 06:21:44] <lulzorz> Cosmo_: the thing about C is it doesn't really quirk a lot

[2013-01-14 06:22:16] <dyadic> C gives you plenty of rope to hang yourself though
[2013-01-14 06:22:19] <lulzorz> but C pretty much does what you tell it
[2013-01-14 06:22:41] <zeke> seems like python is everywhere though, no?
[2013-01-14 06:22:51] <rr645> That's the problem I've had with my attempts to code. It inevitably does what I tell it.
[2013-01-14 06:22:56] <lulzorz> you can assign an int a pointer's value and use it as an array index if you want
[2013-01-14 06:23:01] <dyadic> zeke: C is more places probably
[2013-01-14 06:23:14] <lulzorz> zeke: python is fucking slow, like, slower than java
[2013-01-14 06:23:18] <zeke> fair enough.  I'll make it my launch point
[2013-01-14 06:23:31] <dyadic> yeah, the trade-off with python is RAD
[2013-01-14 06:23:46] <dyadic> easy to prototype stuff, easy to do work, son
[2013-01-14 06:23:47] <dyadic> etc.
[2013-01-14 06:23:48] <lulzorz> well...it starts faster than java
[2013-01-14 06:24:30] <lulzorz> java does starts slow, does things slow the first time, and then starts to approach a speed which could be described as "c-like"
[2013-01-14 06:24:40] <dyadic> and then learn Haskell, so that you can marvel at the beauty of your code and then 2 hours later hate your life
[2013-01-14 06:24:46] <dyadic> and alternate back and forth, forever
[2013-01-14 06:24:51] <lulzorz> python starts fast and then just goes about 1/100 the speed of C
[2013-01-14 06:25:17] <dyadic> 1/1000 for simple loops
[2013-01-14 06:25:25] <dyadic> cause of the slowballs lists
[2013-01-14 06:25:29] <lulzorz> but it's great for network stuff where you spend most of your time waiting
[2013-01-14 06:25:34] <dyadic> cython p nice
[2013-01-14 06:26:13] <lulzorz> and you simply can't buffer overflow it...it just doesn't work that way
[2013-01-14 06:27:28] <dyadic> I think my favorite aspects of python are those borrowed from list based languages

[2013-01-14 06:27:41] <dyadic> I love list comprehensions
[2013-01-14 06:27:47] <dyadic> so convenient
[2013-01-14 06:27:52] <iIIustrious> anyone used lisp? that was a damn learning curve
[2013-01-14 06:27:53] <absolutezeroff> probably one of my favourite python language features
[2013-01-14 06:28:03] <absolutezeroff> i used a bit of lisp, never really learned it fully
[2013-01-14 06:28:06] <dyadic> iIIustrious: yeah, occasionally
[2013-01-14 06:28:09] <dyadic> though scheme moreso
[2013-01-14 06:28:13] <absolutezeroff> scheme is lisp
[2013-01-14 06:28:19] <absolutezeroff> unless by lisp you mean common lisp
[2013-01-14 06:28:21] <lulzorz> I never thought lisp was useful
[2013-01-14 06:28:21] <dyadic> scheme is a lisp
[2013-01-14 06:28:34] <lulzorz> "oh, you can rearrange lists? how cute..."
[2013-01-14 06:28:34] <dyadic> clisp is usually what people mean by lisp tho
[2013-01-14 06:28:39] <dyadic> or cmlisp
[2013-01-14 06:28:45] <lulzorz> gcl ftw
[2013-01-14 06:29:04] <lulzorz> and then I'd get lost in layers of debug shells...
[2013-01-14 06:29:05] <Lurker69> i love learning from you guys, coding is really important and i suck at it, always have to compenzate my macl of cosind skills with googling
[2013-01-14 06:29:24] <Lurker69> lack of coding*
[2013-01-14 06:29:51] <dyadic> all the particulars of a given language don't amount to much, it's the things that you are able to express in that language that you're really learning
[2013-01-14 06:29:56] <dyadic> and that are really important
[2013-01-14 06:30:02] <dyadic> the rest is just convenience
[2013-01-14 06:30:10] <dyadic> that was directed to Lurker69
[2013-01-14 06:30:46] <dyadic> so, once you start learning a language, all the others will be easier
[2013-01-14 06:30:52] <dyadic> within reason and paradigms
[2013-01-14 06:31:02] <lulzorz> ...and then there's lisp
[2013-01-14 06:31:07] <lulzorz> which doesn't fit at all with anything
[2013-01-14 06:31:10] <dyadic> eg C -> Haskell will be a fresh experience
[2013-01-14 06:31:23] <dyadic> lisp fits in the list-based language paradigm :P
[2013-01-14 06:31:31] <lulzorz> and ruby, which is unparseable for the first week
[2013-01-14 06:31:32] <dyadic> and functional, sort of
[2013-01-14 06:31:37] <dyadic> haha ruby
[2013-01-14 06:31:51] <dyadic> god I avoid ruby, personal taste
[2013-01-14 06:32:11] <lulzorz> I swear, ruby devs were like, "fuck lisp, too many parens, let's make a lanauge with NONE!"
[2013-01-14 06:32:35] <lulzorz> and then they used satanic rituals to decide on names for stdlib functions
[2013-01-14 06:32:37] <dyadic> the weak type...stuff
[2013-01-14 06:32:44] <dyadic> put me off the first time I looked at it
[2013-01-14 06:33:33] <lulzorz> I would have more to bitch about, but I ran for my life when I tried to learn how to deal with databases ruby on rails

[2013-01-14 06:41:49] <lulzorz> but that hasn't lead anywhere either
[2013-01-14 06:42:11] <lulzorz> wisdom and folly are the focus right now, I think
[2013-01-14 06:42:45] <lulzorz> but I can't think of any way to perturb them into spitting out something we don't know that hasn't been done already
[2013-01-14 06:43:19] <dyadic> I've been tossing around some awfully disturbing idea
[2013-01-14 06:43:36] <dyadic> we are given this list of primes, sans a couple missing ones
[2013-01-14 06:44:02] <lulzorz> more than a couple, something like 16 lines of 8 each (not sure about those numbers)
[2013-01-14 06:44:14] <dyadic> I hope we're not supposed to use some kind of goedel numbering on them for a message :/
[2013-01-14 06:44:32] <dyadic> hmm
[2013-01-14 06:45:25] <dyadic> I don't really have any idea how wild these will get as I didn't participate in it last year, but everything I think of seems monstrous
[2013-01-14 06:46:28] <lulzorz> last year, everything was exactly as it seemed
[2013-01-14 06:46:36] <lulzorz> with the excpetion of the tab/space code
[2013-01-14 06:46:50] <lulzorz> and possibly the midi
[2013-01-14 06:46:55] <Cosmo_> dyadic: I know the feeling. There's so much it COULD be but i don't know the limits
[2013-01-14 06:47:09] <iII|afk> last year they didn't have a well documented previous attempt though
[2013-01-14 06:47:34] <dyadic> yeah I feel like we could wander down number theory land forever
[2013-01-14 06:47:42] <iII|afk> they must have written this year assuming we'd go look at all their old tricks
[2013-01-14 06:47:47] <lulzorz> the only link between last year and this year is outguess, the tab/space code, and the PGP key
[2013-01-14 06:47:55] <dyadic> hmm
[2013-01-14 06:48:13] <lulzorz> I don't think any of last year's stuff can be applied this year
[2013-01-14 06:48:16] <iII|afk> even the outguess though. They hinted last year to use outguess, this year assumed people would try it
[2013-01-14 06:48:33] <zeke> hey, i was away from all of this for a few days, so please stop me if you've heard this one before, but, someone did notice that the book of wisdom and folly is another text by crowley, right?
[2013-01-14 06:48:34] <dyadic> so have people tried other operators?  or?  and?  compound operations?
[2013-01-14 06:48:51] <iII|afk> I'm with you generally though, I think they'd assume we know last year and not re-use where they could
[2013-01-14 06:48:57] <zeke> could we be back to a book cypher?
[2013-01-14 06:49:21] <lulzorz> the problem is we don't have anything to use right now
[2013-01-14 06:49:22] <dyadic> zeke: might be, who knows

[2013-01-14 06:50:11] <lulzorz> but xoring these doesn't work
[2013-01-14 06:50:19] <dyadic> well rather, all of them weren't low enough
[2013-01-14 06:50:35] <lulzorz> we have the gematria, but what does that do?
[2013-01-14 06:50:37] <dyadic> how far in has 13 been used?  perhaps it is further than I looked
[2013-01-14 06:50:38] <lulzorz> no runes for it
[2013-01-14 06:50:57] <lulzorz> dyadic: length of the twitter, I think
[2013-01-14 06:51:07] <dyadic> hmm

[2013-01-14 08:22:36] <dyadic> iIIustrious: what is happening in that part of the movie when this is said? Kevin Flynn: Your old man's about to knock on the sky and listen to the sound.
[2013-01-14 08:22:39] <Cosmo_> If you guys really want I can export the sound on it's own, or just tell you guys how to do it
[2013-01-14 08:23:16] <dyadic> Cosmo_: is it constant or does it cut in and out at all?
[2013-01-14 08:23:35] <iIIustrious> I think he says it a few times actually
[2013-01-14 08:23:39] <iIIustrious> It's been awhile
[2013-01-14 08:23:51] <Cosmo_> It gets louder as the soung does leading me to believe it's background sound created by the guitar

[2013-01-14 08:25:41] <scrounger> what would knocking be in network engineering?  Ping, maybe?
[2013-01-14 08:25:47] <dyadic> port knocking
[2013-01-14 08:25:50] <Cosmo_> in sound engineering? nothing.
[2013-01-14 08:25:56] <Cosmo_> Well i say that
[2013-01-14 08:26:00] <Cosmo_> nothing I've heard
[2013-01-14 08:26:27] <dyadic> scrounger: port knocking is a possibility
[2013-01-14 08:26:56] <Tech1> you guys don't think it's just a random phrase to set us back on track?
[2013-01-14 08:27:28] <scrounger> true. but, pinging is basically knocking right? and it's the one thing we've got right now.
[2013-01-14 08:27:35] <Cosmo_> I do tech but they chose a specific quote, so it's probably nodding at a particular bit
[2013-01-14 08:27:48] <anon4043> zen koans are made to make you think outside the box
[2013-01-14 08:27:58] <zeke> tech1 the part about having everything you need, yes.  the knocking, sems like a clue to me. . .
[2013-01-14 08:29:49] <Tech1> yeah, i'm sure that quote was chosen for a specific reason. we just have to think.
[2013-01-14 08:31:04] <scrounger> so what do we know about ping?
[2013-01-14 08:31:04] <Cooper5> Knocking on the sky...
[2013-01-14 08:31:10] <resonance> has anyone noticed the weird filesize of 560.13 ?
[2013-01-14 08:31:16] <Cooper5> Maybe a reference to radio waves of some sort?
[2013-01-14 08:31:24] <Cooper5> Yes we have resonance
[2013-01-14 08:31:25] <dyadic> resonance: yes
[2013-01-14 08:31:36] <dyadic> Cooper5: yeah maybe ham...
[2013-01-14 08:31:43] <dyadic> that'd be fuckin' odd
[2013-01-14 08:31:45] <Cooper5> A moon bounce maybe
[2013-01-14 08:32:10] <Cooper5> It's possible to bounce signals off the moon to send them long distances.
[2013-01-14 08:32:19] <dyadic> knocking on the sky, morse code
[2013-01-14 08:32:24] <scrounger> ping is named after sonar, and it's also similar to knocking to see if someone is home, right?
[2013-01-14 08:32:29] <dyadic> too off the beaten path though
[2013-01-14 08:32:34] <dyadic> yes
[2013-01-14 08:32:38] <Cooper5> Anyone here with a good shortwave radio?
[2013-01-14 08:32:52] <dyadic> I think that's a stretch honestly
[2013-01-14 08:32:55] <scrounger> it's also the ONLY thing the server is known to do.
[2013-01-14 08:33:12] <scrounger> there's gotta be a reason they have the onion site showing the real-world IP, right?
[2013-01-14 08:33:23] <Cooper5> What is the ip?
[2013-01-14 08:33:23] <dyadic> yeah
[2013-01-14 08:34:55] <scrounger> just casuse a 404 and it reports it. not sure off the top of my haed

[2013-01-14 08:40:17] <Lurker69> so do you think we need to hack some way into linode server via clearnet?
[2013-01-14 08:40:55] <Tech1> unles someone's sitting on a 0-day for ubnutu / apache 2.2.22, probably not going to happen
[2013-01-14 08:41:15] <Tech1> and if you are, people will pay serious cash for that.
[2013-01-14 08:41:23] <Lurker69> i think that if cicada provided aditional clue , it would be starange if they put that clue on the source of the thing we missed
[2013-01-14 08:41:30] <Lurker69> i tell that strange...
[2013-01-14 08:41:46] <Lurker69> well i mean that thing we are missing is not on to2 or linode server

[2013-01-14 08:57:24] <dyadic> you know
[2013-01-14 08:57:48] <dyadic> knock on the sky and listen for the sound could also mean, open a port and listen for an incoming connection

[2013-01-14 09:42:28] <Cosmo_> And for once I understand what's happening.
[2013-01-14 09:43:50] <Tech1_Phone> Something tells me that isnt happening on 761.mp3
[2013-01-14 09:45:18] <Cosmo_> Nope, all analogue and no sampling
[2013-01-14 09:45:31] <dyadic> well
[2013-01-14 09:45:42] <dyadic> there is a rune representing the yew tree
[2013-01-14 09:45:54] <dyadic> corresponding to 41 in our thing

[2013-01-14 09:46:21] <dyadic> maybe we need to find those amongst the data files, hrm
[2013-01-14 09:46:26] <Cosmo_> there's 4 runes that represent trees. yew, ash, oak i think... and something else. I tried to memorise the table....it didn't go well.
[2013-01-14 09:46:56] <Tech1_Phone> i'm pretty sure we have everything we can get out of the iso. but here's a valid point: if we look at the iso/image as the central linking point to all of the info we have so far...it seems to be the center of everything.
[2013-01-14 09:47:25] <Tech1_Phone> did we use a file from the iso on just about everything we have so far?
[2013-01-14 09:47:52] <dyadic> for xoring yeah
[2013-01-14 09:48:00] <resonance> well the hint said to not look at the tree otherwise u can't see the forest??
[2013-01-14 09:48:16] <resonance> i assume it is saying don't look within the iso but look at the  iso itself ?
[2013-01-14 09:48:23] <Tech1_Phone> So the iso may be that forest
[2013-01-14 09:48:28] <resonance> correct
[2013-01-14 09:48:47] <Cosmo_> ^These guys on the same wavelength =P  Ok but how the hell do you use it as a whole?
[2013-01-14 09:48:51] <resonance> has the iso file i tself been analyzed ?
[2013-01-14 09:49:08] <dyadic> resonance: yeah but I'mthinking it could be something hidden amongst those
[2013-01-14 09:49:19] <dyadic> remove them and the data might be meaningful
[2013-01-14 09:49:22] <dyadic> I donno, fuckit
[2013-01-14 09:49:55] <dyadic> 13 is large enough to be a small video clip ffs
[2013-01-14 09:50:05] <resonance> correct
[2013-01-14 09:50:12] <resonance> notice that 13 and 17 both primes too
[2013-01-14 09:50:21] <dyadic> yeah
[2013-01-14 09:50:28] <resonance> so are the filesizes
[2013-01-14 09:50:33] <dyadic> yep
[2013-01-14 09:50:49] <resonance> possible offset?
[2013-01-14 09:51:22] <dyadic> 560 ~ -1 (mod 17), 560 ~ 1 (mod 13)

[2013-01-14 09:53:25] <dyadic> hmm
[2013-01-14 09:53:55] <resonance> and the dates are odd
[2013-01-14 09:54:03] <resonance> there is a whole day different between 560.13 and 560.17

[2013-01-14 09:54:18] <resonance> could we minus the times and come up with something.. ?

[2013-01-14 10:11:10] <scrounger> why would cicada lead us towards  1 direction, and then not have the next step there? doesn't make any sense.
[2013-01-14 10:12:55] <resonance> have all the primes been ussed yet?

[2013-01-14 10:14:19] <dyadic> which tor site
[2013-01-14 10:15:21] <resonance> i thought someone above suggested soundcloud ?

[2013-01-14 10:32:57] <Lurker69> soulseekah: you just play it and FLDIGI does its magic, no idea how
[2013-01-14 10:32:59] <soulseekah> can we demodulate that?

[2013-01-14 10:33:14] <Cosmo_> Hmm....
[2013-01-14 10:33:14] <soulseekah> if it's modulated at one of the frequencies
[2013-01-14 10:33:24] <Lurker69> but you have to know the frequency
[2013-01-14 10:33:31] <soulseekah> 14.070 MHz	maybe
[2013-01-14 10:33:35] <soulseekah> closest to 15
[2013-01-14 10:33:43] <soulseekah> or the center frequency of that line
[2013-01-14 10:33:46] <soulseekah> 15.8k
[2013-01-14 10:33:55] <soulseekah> oh shit MHz forget it
[2013-01-14 10:34:02] <n_factor> it sounds more like psk than any other digital radio signal i know of
[2013-01-14 10:34:04] <soulseekah> but 15.8k demodulate that
[2013-01-14 10:34:25] <n_factor> its peak is about 15670 hz
[2013-01-14 10:34:33] <soulseekah> it looks like FM
[2013-01-14 10:34:35] <n_factor> which is 10x 1567, a prime
[2013-01-14 10:34:40] <soulseekah> but anything looks like FM
[2013-01-14 10:35:09] <soulseekah> what's the sampling rate of the mp3 btw? 44k?
[2013-01-14 10:35:47] <Cosmo_> 44.1k
[2013-01-14 10:35:56] <n_factor> maybe play around with audio output db and squelch levels on your psk decoder
[2013-01-14 10:36:10] <soulseekah> psk has to sound like psk
[2013-01-14 10:36:15] <n_factor> yes
[2013-01-14 10:36:37] <soulseekah> and it may sound in different ways
[2013-01-14 10:36:45] <n_factor> isnt there a psk mode that uses 2 frequencies?
[2013-01-14 10:36:48] <soulseekah> like http://70.90.239.101/2012-09-17%2005-00%20UTC%20-%20303-309-0004%20-%202896.wav sounds very different

[2013-01-14 10:37:31] <Lurker69> http://prntscr.com/p4ndg  dont panic at first numbers and letters noise like that is common at psk 31
[2013-01-14 10:37:48] <soulseekah> PSK31's bandwidth of 31.25 Hz was chosen because a normal typing speed of about 50 words per minute requires a bit rate of about 32 bits per second, and specifically because 31.25 Hz could easily be derived from the 8 kHz sample rate used in many DSP systems, including those used in the computer sound cards commonly used for PSK31 operation (31.25 Hz is 8 kHz divided by 256, and so can be derived from 8 kHz by halving the frequency eight
[2013-01-14 10:37:49] <soulseekah> times).

[2013-01-14 10:40:14] <Cosmo_> For JUST that signal? the isolated signal?
[2013-01-14 10:40:34] <Cosmo_> Yeah it's huge.
[2013-01-14 10:40:56] <Lurker69> i think you dont have to isolate the signal, fl gidi listens to only cerrtain frequencies
[2013-01-14 10:41:15] <soulseekah> Lurker69, you're very right
[2013-01-14 10:41:50] <Cosmo_> Alright i'm downloading this thing I'm curious now
[2013-01-14 10:42:20] <soulseekah> that mp3 is like the whole radio frequency space
[2013-01-14 10:42:27] <soulseekah> and we have to tune into a specific part of it
[2013-01-14 10:42:31] <soulseekah> to start decoding
[2013-01-14 10:42:54] <soulseekah> that line at the top looks very right
[2013-01-14 10:43:26] <soulseekah> data modulated at 15.8k
[2013-01-14 10:46:31] <Anonaneno> okay so I telnet'd into the tor and after the "I have a message for you" blurb... what kind of response should I expect from typing stuff in?
[2013-01-14 10:47:00] <soulseekah> Anonaneno, read wiki section about onion1, lists all commands and solutions
[2013-01-14 10:47:45] <Anonaneno> my bad - I'll read up... just wondering because I entered the file sizes of the .13 and .17 and got a response...
[2013-01-14 10:48:09] <soulseekah> that would be the number commfand

[2013-01-14 15:29:30] <crash_demons> given the tendancy for them to nuke files
[2013-01-14 15:30:03] <Lurker69> D90: indeed, prize comes with the pursuit, knowledge you gain during solving , people you met...
[2013-01-14 15:30:12] <crash_demons> or does that just mean "read data that was unallocated" ?
[2013-01-14 15:31:15] <Lurker69> arent there tons of USB recovery tools?
[2013-01-14 15:31:25] <Guest55067> This kind of activity also creates buy in.
[2013-01-14 15:31:54] <D90> Luker69 yes, there are.
[2013-01-14 15:32:05] <Guest55067> What about the files Wisdom and Folly?
[2013-01-14 15:32:15] <Guest55067> That sounds like a reference to Psalms
[2013-01-14 15:32:30] <Guest55067> They're exactly the same?
[2013-01-14 15:32:41] <crash_demons> Lurker69, if it's just scanning the filesystem for files that used to exist. sure.

[2013-01-14 15:39:22] <D90> Something old as shit wouldn't be used for this 'puzzle' I believe. It would be vauge.
[2013-01-14 15:39:34] <Lurker69> agreed
[2013-01-14 15:40:08] <D90> We don't need to look at it. The website is out of the window.
[2013-01-14 15:40:10] <Lurker69> on the end there bmust be some logical computer operation we  have to do with that file
[2013-01-14 15:40:23] <crash_demons> also re:unsolved.  this implies Crowley wasn't batshit insane and the message could actually be decoded by normal people.
[2013-01-14 15:40:31] <Lurker69> burning csandels and drawing pentagrams wont help much
[2013-01-14 15:40:48] <Lurker69> consider how vague first hint eas
[2013-01-14 15:40:51] <Lurker69> was*
[2013-01-14 15:41:15] <Lurker69> "key is all around you!"   ----->   go to the twiiter
[2013-01-14 15:41:38] <Lurker69> pretty vague to conect birds singing in te woods to "key is allaround you"
[2013-01-14 15:42:12] <D90> So, the hint: "knock on the sky and listen to the sound." is also (maybe) vague.

[2013-01-14 15:43:32] <D90> ?
[2013-01-14 15:43:52] <NikTitanik> knock on a combination of ports and a port should open just for the ip that knocked

[2013-01-14 15:49:39] <Lurker69> iII|away: said it is from some movie
[2013-01-14 15:50:42] <NikTitanik> some zen master said it
[2013-01-14 15:50:45] <crash_demons> that doesn't really jive with "you already have everything you need"
[2013-01-14 15:51:12] <D90> The line comes in many different places.
[2013-01-14 15:51:13] <crash_demons> I think the instruction is to sit back and think about how to combine the pieces
[2013-01-14 15:52:05] <Lurker69> [2013-01-14 08:22:36] <dyadic> iIIustrious: what is happening in that part of the movie when this is said? Kevin Flynn: Your old man's about to knock on the sky and listen to the sound.

[2013-01-14 16:03:16] <crash_demons> if 3301 was making a direct reference to a Manson/DaftPunk song or the Tron reboot, I would be very disappointed in the quality.

[2013-01-14 16:04:16] <crash_demons> but the message is different from "look for shit"
[2013-01-14 16:04:20] <Lurker69> ^crash you are probably right, but MAnson and DaftPunk are both one of the best rock artists of their era
[2013-01-14 16:04:23] <crash_demons> more "dont look for shit"
[2013-01-14 16:04:36] <Cosmo_> Or....look for what ISN'T there.

[2013-01-14 16:05:50] <crash_demons> "You already have everything you need to continue."   this doesn't read like we need to look for any new content at all, just combine/decode/apply things we already recorded

[2013-01-14 16:38:58] <crash_demons> Lurker69, there are tons of old threads on google for 4chan that are long-dead and just redirect to unrelated ones or to the index.
[2013-01-14 16:39:17] <Cosmo_> I went for a walk and.... i MAY have had a thought....
[2013-01-14 16:39:43] <Lurker69> crash_demons: yes possible, same adress as old thread
[2013-01-14 16:39:49] <crash_demons> resonance, no need for a notice;  blank 4chan post with a JPEG. the hash was attached to the end of the file with an ascii arrow <-----
[2013-01-14 16:40:04] <Lurker69> resonance	gpus are spinning up    <----i like that
[2013-01-14 16:40:12] <D90> Cosmo speak
[2013-01-14 16:40:53] <crash_demons> "same address as old thread"  which two threads are we talking about?  the only old thread I know is /r/1450 for the hash crack request.
[2013-01-14 16:41:32] <rr645> Cosmo_, what did you realize?
[2013-01-14 16:41:47] <Cosmo_> So I figure the next thing we're going to be looking for will be a message, or a link. Either will involve letters instead of numbers and i figure we need the gematria to find them....
[2013-01-14 16:41:47] <Lurker69> crash_demons: yes apprently there awes same thread in 2008....  welp my logic is not working
[2013-01-14 16:42:11] <Cosmo_> Now am i wrong in thinking that sometimes the gematria reverses numbers before giving prime factors?
[2013-01-14 16:42:19] <Lurker69> also WHO POSTED TROLL HASHES ON OUR TWITTER?
[2013-01-14 16:42:30] <crash_demons> Lurker69, you're not making any sense to me
[2013-01-14 16:42:30] <Lurker69> i cant solve them and it is driving me nuts
[2013-01-14 16:42:43] <Ymgve> we have a twitter?
[2013-01-14 16:42:55] <iIIustrious> lol, lurk made one and posted the pass

[2013-01-14 16:44:50] <crash_demons> Ymgve, then why does lurker's mouth keep saying it is?
[2013-01-14 16:44:51] <Ymgve> it's just google that interprets the _stickied post from 2008_ as the thread date
[2013-01-14 16:45:06] <zebra> Didnt someone say yesterday that there is a song called knock on the sky?

[2013-01-14 16:46:52] <Ymgve> that I missed
[2013-01-14 16:47:09] <crash_demons> Lurker69, Ymgve you have a major misunderstanding about how 4chan works. http://boards.4chan.org/r/
[2013-01-14 16:47:34] <Lurker69> uh
[2013-01-14 16:47:36] <crash_demons> that thread no longer exists on 4chan. as I said about 10 times before, you are seeing the /r/ index
[2013-01-14 16:47:43] <Ymgve> crash_demons: what's the misunderstanding
[2013-01-14 16:47:58] <Ymgve> the date google shows
[2013-01-14 16:48:01] <Lurker69> every unexistent adress leads to this thread
[2013-01-14 16:48:12] <Ymgve> is the SAME as the _stickied post_
[2013-01-14 16:48:15] <crash_demons> oh right @ date
[2013-01-14 16:48:19] <Ymgve> because google is confused
[2013-01-14 16:48:31] <Lurker69> google never confused
[2013-01-14 16:49:09] <Lurker69> https://twitter.com/114218876441   anyway who posted these three hashes here?
[2013-01-14 16:49:14] <crash_demons> but... /r/ hasn't used  /?<num>.html any time recently
[2013-01-14 16:49:25] <crash_demons> that format is outdated by far
[2013-01-14 16:49:40] <Lurker69> 23 h ago and 32 digits long
[2013-01-14 16:49:42] <crash_demons> so unless google just updated the text from the index (possible)
[2013-01-14 16:50:07] <Ymgve> crash_demons: that's exactly what happened
[2013-01-14 16:50:08] <crash_demons> yeah that must be what it is
[2013-01-14 16:50:27] <Ymgve> google went to /?<num>.html, got the front page, which at that moment had someone requesting info about the hash
[2013-01-14 16:50:47] <Ymgve> google sees date of stickied post, claims page is from 2008
[2013-01-14 16:51:06] <Lurker69> ^makes sense
[2013-01-14 16:51:15] <crash_demons> however, when I first googled that hash nothing came up. I think the /r/ was someone who read the same thread we did and requested it after?
[2013-01-14 16:51:28] <Ymgve> yes
[2013-01-14 16:51:37] <Ymgve> someone _said  so_ in that thread
[2013-01-14 16:51:44] <crash_demons> which then begs the question, why did lurker make me google this again?
[2013-01-14 16:51:44] <Lurker69> ^i also remember that  google didnt find it at first, i think next day it came up on google
[2013-01-14 16:51:48] <Ymgve> "i asked /r/ about it maybe they know something"
[2013-01-14 16:51:50] <crash_demons> :|
[2013-01-14 16:51:56] <D90> It would be stupid to post a thread on 4chan, cause it would disappear fast.

[2013-01-14 17:46:48] <Ymgve> basically at where we are now, they said "combine these three things to get a web address" outright
[2013-01-14 17:47:37] <crash_demons> have wisdom/folly been used for anything yet?
[2013-01-14 17:47:44] <iIIustrious> no

[2013-01-14 17:47:45] <iIIustrious> not yet
[2013-01-14 17:48:03] <crash_demons> (and why is the wiki so poorly organized)
[2013-01-14 17:48:03] <iIIustrious> so it's almost certainly something we need to work with now
[2013-01-14 17:48:04] <scrounger> but guys, everything so far has been straight forward. if they say go here, there's an answer there.
[2013-01-14 17:48:04] <scrounger> they said go to the second onion.
[2013-01-14 17:48:21] <scrounger> there has to be an answer there
[2013-01-14 17:48:43] <Tech1> unless they opened up a magic telnet/nc port, i doubt there is much on the 2nd onoin
[2013-01-14 17:48:43] <Tech1> *onoin
[2013-01-14 17:48:43] <Tech1> *ONION.
[2013-01-14 17:48:48] <scrounger> unless there's something deep inside what's already there, right?
[2013-01-14 17:48:57] <crash_demons> well, it is an HTTP server. you could GET something if you knew what to get
[2013-01-14 17:49:12] <rr645-afk> I JUST FINISHED nc'ing all the ports on the second onion. I'll be irate if they open a port now that I'm done...
[2013-01-14 17:49:12] <scrounger> but, judging from cicada last year and this year, it's ALWAYS where they say it will be...
[2013-01-14 17:49:37] <scrounger> so, I'm betting it's either in the onion web service or something to do with ping.
[2013-01-14 17:50:14] <D90> interessting

[2013-01-14 17:50:47] <rr645-afk> It changed once, I've been paranoid….
[2013-01-14 17:52:01] <crash_demons> out of curiosity, what is the "count" output for "knock on the sky and listen to the sound." ?

[2013-01-14 17:52:35] <scrounger> pinging is kind of like knocking, right?
[2013-01-14 17:52:42] <scrounger> that could be the hint?
[2013-01-14 17:53:08] <scrounger> I mean, there are only two things that the second onion does: web server that doxes itself, and respond to pings

[2013-01-14 17:54:39] <D90> The whole puzzle is a question
[2013-01-14 17:54:44] <scrounger> there are only 2 options: web, and ping.
[2013-01-14 17:54:52] <Ymgve> are you doing it thru tor or directly at the host?
[2013-01-14 17:55:05] <Tech1> can't ping via tor
[2013-01-14 17:55:05] <scrounger> everything else takes a back burner to finding the next step rigth?
[2013-01-14 17:55:17] <scrounger> the 404 message provides the internet hostname
[2013-01-14 17:55:27] <scrounger> no open ports, but it responds to pings
[2013-01-14 17:55:48] <Ymgve> welll the 404 could be faked
[2013-01-14 17:56:00] <Ymgve> what happens ifyou try an unsupported method
[2013-01-14 17:56:13] <scrounger> even if it is, it tells us they want to look there, right?
[2013-01-14 17:56:32] <scrounger> hell, even moreso if it's faked
[2013-01-14 17:56:58] <scrounger> i mean, do we really think that cicada, of all people, fucked up their tor configuration to dox themselves on accident?
[2013-01-14 17:57:14] <D90> would be funny.
[2013-01-14 17:57:15] <soulseekah> Ymgve, pretty sure the webserver is legit

[2013-01-14 18:18:22] <soulseekah> Cosmo_, well any result of xor can be gematria-encoded
[2013-01-14 18:18:40] <soulseekah> which can then be decoded using the table
[2013-01-14 18:19:00] <Cosmo_> Ymgve: it says "站点维护中..."
[2013-01-14 18:19:11] <Cosmo_> google thinks that means
[2013-01-14 18:19:15] <Cosmo_> "Site maintenance in ..."
[2013-01-14 18:20:13] <Cosmo_> I wonder what happens when you google search in runes....

[2013-01-14 18:24:12] <resonance> i've decided to replciate the results incase something has been missed.
[2013-01-14 18:24:26] <resonance> I cannot successfully xor the tweet stream with the mp3
[2013-01-14 18:24:51] <resonance> here is the tweet stream i'm using

[2013-01-14 18:27:09] <Cosmo_> It's a shame it used the gematria ANd missing primes. The only thing that caught my eye was the W W W O
[2013-01-14 18:28:09] <Cosmo_> Because there's no punctuation conversion it could have been www.

[2013-01-14 18:30:24] <soulseekah> indigo_|School, use the clearnet port then
[2013-01-14 18:30:30] <soulseekah> the computer is bound to have telnet
[2013-01-14 18:30:52] <soulseekah> telnet to codeseekah.com 3301
[2013-01-14 18:31:00] <indigo_|School> they have custom flashes on these computers, they removed everything

[2013-01-14 18:31:03] <indigo_|School> Does windows have a built in client?
[2013-01-14 18:31:16] <soulseekah> yes, it's called "telnet"
[2013-01-14 18:31:32] <crash_demons> why does my program die when I try to load the mp3 + tweets to xor :| the fuck. it doesn't do this with any other file
[2013-01-14 18:31:36] <resonance> i have managed to replicate the hint with _560.00 only

[2013-01-14 18:32:21] <soulseekah> indigo_|School, cmd.exe and type telnet
[2013-01-14 18:32:22] <crash_demons> which version?
[2013-01-14 18:32:48] <resonance> 2.9
[2013-01-14 18:32:56] <soulseekah> indigo_|School, or try start - run - telnet.exe codeseekah.com 3301
[2013-01-14 18:33:00] <indigo_|School> soulseekah : Their PATH varible isn't pointing to the directory that its in, I found the exe anyway in some random folder
[2013-01-14 18:33:02] <soulseekah> indigo_|School, something of that kind
[2013-01-14 18:33:04] <crash_demons> ohh, I forgot ffs, it scans lower tolerances without notification.
[2013-01-14 18:33:24] <crash_demons> originally when I wrote the program it told the user about everything.
[2013-01-14 18:33:49] <crash_demons> yeah nvm, it didn't hang, just no immediate returns
[2013-01-14 18:34:00] <resonance> whats the scan used for?
[2013-01-14 18:34:22] <crash_demons> finding text output with an unknown offset
[2013-01-14 18:34:39] <resonance> ic
[2013-01-14 18:34:50] <resonance> umm have u tried replicating 560.13 with the tweets?
[2013-01-14 18:34:58] <crash_demons> I don't have that file
[2013-01-14 18:35:04] <resonance> which file ?
[2013-01-14 18:35:12] <resonance> 560.13 or the tweets?
[2013-01-14 18:35:18] <crash_demons> 560
[2013-01-14 18:35:44] <crash_demons> and I've been slacking off so I don't know which A^B=C
[2013-01-14 18:36:13] <indigo_|School> soulseekah : The only telet client on this comp doesn't work, do you know of any that work without installing them
[2013-01-14 18:36:16] <indigo_|School> flashdrive esque
[2013-01-14 18:36:18] <lulzorz> crash_demons: try sliding window of wisdom/folly with the iso
[2013-01-14 18:36:35] <lulzorz> look for PGP, JPG, PNG headers
[2013-01-14 18:36:37] <soulseekah> indigo_|School, what's the error?
[2013-01-14 18:36:37] <crash_demons> lulzorz, I don't have the ISO, I'm on dialup :|
[2013-01-14 18:36:49] <lulzorz> (and maybe MP3, considering the new hint)
[2013-01-14 18:36:58] <lulzorz> lol
[2013-01-14 18:37:16] <crash_demons> any files under 100kb, I could download though
[2013-01-14 18:37:26] <indigo_|School> soulseekah : running the exe gives no feedback in cmd,  does nothing at all.  --help or -h flags do nothing either
[2013-01-14 18:37:28] <crash_demons> so you *could* give me the beginning part of relevant files.
[2013-01-14 18:37:36] <resonance> crash_demons ok its going
[2013-01-14 18:37:36] <iIIustrious> huh
[2013-01-14 18:37:44] <resonance> yea
[2013-01-14 18:37:53] <lulzorz> crash_demons: well, the idea is to hit all the files with a sliding window
[2013-01-14 18:37:53] <resonance> i'm thinking just send u the first few MBs of the file
[2013-01-14 18:38:04] <soulseekah> indigo_|School, http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/putty_portable try this one?
[2013-01-14 18:38:06] <iIIustrious> if you do a shift off 3301 on folly or wisdom, you got something of a length that could easily be a message or a link
[2013-01-14 18:38:09] <crash_demons> be aware that scan mode doesn't detect headers. only large amounts of text.

[2013-01-14 18:38:45] <lulzorz> or, if your code doesn't suck, give it to me and I will
[2013-01-14 18:38:53] <crash_demons> lulzorz, each header is different? how many do I program in?
[2013-01-14 18:39:15] <lulzorz> crash_demons: just those 4...probably can forget about PNG actually
[2013-01-14 18:39:21] <crash_demons> it already has a GZIP detection mode ('g') but it reduces the speed of normal scans
[2013-01-14 18:39:46] <crash_demons> hmm
[2013-01-14 18:39:47] <resonance> crash_demons how do i know if the scan is finished?
[2013-01-14 18:39:50] <resonance> will something show up?
[2013-01-14 18:39:54] <disksucker> anything new in the last 12 hours?
[2013-01-14 18:40:08] <lulzorz> disksucker: onion changed
[2013-01-14 18:40:49] <crash_demons> resonance, It scans at each tolerance level until at least 1 result is found in that level. after the scan in that level is finished it will return to the command prompt
[2013-01-14 18:40:54] <crash_demons> (or exit)
[2013-01-14 18:41:33] <resonance> i guess this could take a while
[2013-01-14 18:41:40] <crash_demons> that is, it starts at 100% match (all message window chars readable [up to 256]) then one lower each time
[2013-01-14 18:42:07] <crash_demons> usually it finds what you're looking for quickly, or some bullshit later

[2013-01-14 18:49:33] <Ymgve> well that's another idea wasted down the drain
[2013-01-14 18:49:34] <resonance> but u can't
[2013-01-14 18:49:46] <qwefasdf> and concerning the game, if I'm not mistaken the music and missing primes are just few among the countless things unexplained
[2013-01-14 18:49:49] <Ymgve> I thought if we were supposed to xor wisdom/folly with something
[2013-01-14 18:49:54] <Ymgve> and the result would be text
[2013-01-14 18:50:02] <qwefasdf> the game before this, did cicada leave clues that in the end weren't important?
[2013-01-14 18:50:04] <resonance> anyone done

[2013-01-14 18:50:14] <Ymgve> then the highest bit of each byte would have to be eliminated
[2013-01-14 18:50:15] <iIIustrious> sure did
[2013-01-14 18:50:22] <Cosmo_> i think the missing primes and the gematria are connected. It makes sense.....but i'm having a hard time explaining why =P
[2013-01-14 18:50:24] <iIIustrious> nothing usable
[2013-01-14 18:50:33] <Ymgve> which meant some data would have the same sequence of high bits as wisdom
[2013-01-14 18:50:35] <iIIustrious> I tried at offsets 3301 and 1033 with each
[2013-01-14 18:50:40] <qwefasdf> because I'm not sure what's the purpose of the mp3 other than to sound creepy
[2013-01-14 18:50:41] <Ymgve> no such luck

[2013-01-14 18:52:24] <resonance> crash_demons it's fine. I just thought the scanning process could be sped up using OpenMP because that can automatically thread for loops but it's not going to work in this instance

[2013-01-14 18:53:12] <qwefasdf> anyone tried checking what notes/chords are played in the mp3? perhaps they spell out something
[2013-01-14 18:53:12] <lulzorz> google code is so 2008
[2013-01-14 18:53:18] <lulzorz> it went out with sourceforge
[2013-01-14 18:53:54] <crash_demons> lulzorz, it takes too long to load.  and I started one github project and it was like living in a desert. nobody wanted to touch it.
[2013-01-14 18:54:07] <crash_demons> which is odd because I hear the opposite all the time

[2013-01-14 18:55:17] <crash_demons> resonance, really, for exact matches, the program is decently fast for me. maybe the benefit would be for header check modes though - unless you want to scan an entire ISO, that might take a while

[2013-01-14 20:10:03] <disksucker> Knock on the sky and listen to the sound
[2013-01-14 20:10:11] <rr645> What key was that guitar playing in, anyone remember? G#, wasn't i?
[2013-01-14 20:11:30] <brotherBox> Yes.
[2013-01-14 20:11:30] <disksucker> wiki says G#
[2013-01-14 20:11:35] <iIIustrious> so, I was trying to convert the letters in the parable to numbers to see if a pattern emerged
[2013-01-14 20:11:54] <Aloo> Alright, I have a new fire under me to decode the song
[2013-01-14 20:11:58] <iIIustrious> there's only one word that can't convert
[2013-01-14 20:12:11] <iIIustrious> which is divinity
[2013-01-14 20:12:13] <Ymgve> iIIustrious: err, onion1 does it for you
[2013-01-14 20:12:23] <iIIustrious> no, it totals them
[2013-01-14 20:12:27] <iIIustrious> that's different
[2013-01-14 20:12:33] <iIIustrious> it counts them up
[2013-01-14 20:12:35] <Aloo> I'm understanding the riddle as look into the sky with a careful eye ( with a telescope). The same with a song, go microscopic
[2013-01-14 20:12:54] <Ymgve> there's that 16khz thing
[2013-01-14 20:13:00] <soulseekah> will someone demodulate that?
[2013-01-14 20:13:02] <Ymgve> that's like "in the sky" maybe?
[2013-01-14 20:13:22] <Ymgve> but I don't see any clear pattern, it just looks like a line
[2013-01-14 20:13:25] <iIIustrious> the onion1 would say like is 187, the gematria would say it's 73311367
[2013-01-14 20:13:30] <Aloo> Either that or knocking on the sky creates silence...
[2013-01-14 20:13:35] <Aloo> Lets see...
[2013-01-14 20:13:36] <soulseekah> I had no luck decoding it in fldigi with different modes, frequencies
[2013-01-14 20:13:48] <dann_> knock on the sky and listen to the sound, isnt that a poem thing? http://www.rattle.com/poetry/2012/06/knock-on-the-sky-and-listen-to-the-sound-from-the-zen-master-poems-by-dick-allen/
[2013-01-14 20:13:49] <soulseekah> but I think that the 16k line is modulated
[2013-01-14 20:13:57] <Ymgve> soulseekah: did you pre-filter and amplify?
[2013-01-14 20:14:04] <soulseekah> Ymgve, both yes and not
[2013-01-14 20:14:14] <Aloo> modulated? What do you mean?
[2013-01-14 20:14:15] <soulseekah> I did all sorts of preprocessing
[2013-01-14 20:14:26] <soulseekah> Aloo, I mean the 16k is the carrier wave
[2013-01-14 20:14:26] <Ymgve> because the 16khz thing is practically invisible in the normal signal
[2013-01-14 20:14:48] <Aloo> Would you like me to lower it to an audible level?
[2013-01-14 20:15:00] <soulseekah> Aloo, it has to be frequency demodulated
[2013-01-14 20:15:08] <Ymgve> talking about seeing it in the spectrum now
[2013-01-14 20:15:33] <Aloo> I'll have to look up howtodo that soul=
[2013-01-14 20:16:12] <soulseekah> I did try pitchshifting of the 15.4-16.6 band without everythign else too
[2013-01-14 20:16:27] <soulseekah> but nothing, only gibberish is being picked up
[2013-01-14 20:17:14] <Aloo> gibberish would actually be really  nice
[2013-01-14 20:17:18] <PersonalKilljoy> after amplifying and spectral analysis i find out another line which is barely seen even after amplification - might be aswell my imagination
[2013-01-14 20:17:49] <sempf> did anyone try putting g# into onion2?

[2013-01-14 20:22:31] <dann_> could sky be referring to the internet and the "knock" would be a ping?
[2013-01-14 20:22:32] <sempf> i was going to base mine on the wiki
[2013-01-14 20:22:48] <soulseekah> dann_, TCP pinging on onion has been done all 65k ports
[2013-01-14 20:22:49] <sempf> then work out the relations between each stage
[2013-01-14 20:22:51] <alsk> whats being discussed atm?
[2013-01-14 20:23:02] <soulseekah> dann_, UDP knock on clearnet is in progress
[2013-01-14 20:23:06] <sempf> and then just do everything myself
[2013-01-14 20:23:34] =-= rr645 is now known as rr645-afk
[2013-01-14 20:23:47] <dann_> how long will the clearnet knock take?
[2013-01-14 20:23:54] <soulseekah> 10% in so far
[2013-01-14 20:24:01] <soulseekah> been running for like 20 mintues
[2013-01-14 20:24:06] <soulseekah> so 200 minutes
[2013-01-14 20:24:11] <soulseekah> unless it finds something
[2013-01-14 20:24:16] <soulseekah> UDP is funny
[2013-01-14 20:24:23] <dann_> it really is
[2013-01-14 20:24:29] <soulseekah> all connections are always valid
[2013-01-14 20:24:37] <soulseekah> so I'm sending "knock knock" to ports
[2013-01-14 20:24:43] <soulseekah> in hope of some kind of response
[2013-01-14 20:25:02] <dann_> that would be fantastic
[2013-01-14 20:25:19] <soulseekah> I don't think that the actual knock data would matter if this is the correct way
[2013-01-14 20:25:26] <soulseekah> just sending something its way
[2013-01-14 20:25:37] <soulseekah> because for example the way netcat handlesi ncoming connections with pipe data
[2013-01-14 20:25:37] <sempf> could you time it?
[2013-01-14 20:25:48] <soulseekah> is it waits for somethign to be received
[2013-01-14 20:25:51] <soulseekah> before sending it's pipe data
[2013-01-14 20:25:55] <Aloo> Soul, this is some hardcore shit. This program is quite over my head
[2013-01-14 20:26:05] <soulseekah> Aloo, what you do is the following
[2013-01-14 20:26:10] <soulseekah> create audio source
[2013-01-14 20:26:17] <soulseekah> and select wav of 761
[2013-01-14 20:26:26] <soulseekah> then create a sink with audio output
[2013-01-14 20:26:40] <soulseekah> then hit run and see if that even works, because for me it crashed the fuck out
[2013-01-14 20:26:49] <sempf> soulseekah, can you time the time for response?
[2013-01-14 20:26:58] <soulseekah> sempf, therea re no responses
[2013-01-14 20:27:02] <soulseekah> I only have a 5 second timeout
[2013-01-14 20:27:16] <soulseekah> if nothing is received withint 5 seconds of sending it some data
[2013-01-14 20:27:19] <soulseekah> then move on
[2013-01-14 20:27:39] <soulseekah> knocking on the skies here, not a sound so far
[2013-01-14 20:27:40] <Ymgve> no multithreading?

[2013-01-14 20:27:53] <Ymgve> ok

[2013-01-14 20:31:59] <crash_demons> dyadic, not to my knowledge, but it could be lost to the IRC Logs of Time.   Using the table you could construct your own, but that's open to a lot of interpretations

[2013-01-14 20:34:58] <dyadic> plus there are some horrible behaviors I've seen with the 'count' command that make it very hard to replicate its behavior
[2013-01-14 20:35:00] <Ymgve> also, 1 isn't (usually) considered a prime

[2013-01-14 20:36:14] <soulseekah> try knock now and knock knock
[2013-01-14 20:36:35] <crash_demons> I know there's another function it doesn't work for, but I consider that rather a technicality
[2013-01-14 20:36:40] <sempf> exact definition for a prime number is: n is called a prime number when there are exactly two different elements in the natural numbers that divide n
[2013-01-14 20:37:02] <dyadic> I think that given the mp3 was named 760, and 'count The Instar Emergence' outputs 760, should be looking forsomething that outputs 560
[2013-01-14 20:37:59] <dyadic> for data file
[2013-01-14 20:38:00] <iIIustrious> 761
[2013-01-14 20:38:00] <dyadic> er yeah, 761 thanks
[2013-01-14 20:38:00] <sempf> i dont get that thought
[2013-01-14 20:38:00] <iIIustrious> while I agree, there are a lot of words that would add up to 560
[2013-01-14 20:38:07] <iIIustrious> and what could we use it for after the fact?
[2013-01-14 20:38:25] <dyadic> I don't know, but it's a glaring clue
[2013-01-14 20:38:46] <sempf> why, if count the instar emergence returns 760, we should be looking for something that outputs 569
[2013-01-14 20:38:47] <dyadic> perhaps a key, perhaps it would clue us the structure of those files
[2013-01-14 20:39:01] <Ymgve> sempf: it doesn't
[2013-01-14 20:39:03] <dyadic> sempf: it outputs 761, I brainoed
[2013-01-14 20:39:04] <Ymgve> it outputs 761
[2013-01-14 20:39:14] <crash_demons> Ymgve, I know they know better than me but I can't help but feel like like all of those reasons suck.
[2013-01-14 20:39:21] <sempf> oki
[2013-01-14 20:39:32] <Ymgve> crash_demons: you fight the fight then :P
[2013-01-14 20:39:39] <sempf> but why, if it outputs 761, are we looking for an output that returns 560
[2013-01-14 20:39:40] <crash_demons> at least unless you need to apply it in advanced math

[2013-01-14 20:39:51] <sempf> if im not missing something extremely obvious
[2013-01-14 20:40:02] <Ymgve> but they have a point about factoring
[2013-01-14 20:40:02] <iIIustrious> sempf, the data files are named 560
[2013-01-14 20:40:06] <crash_demons> for our purposes here, (and for [number] it appears to be "close enough" )
[2013-01-14 20:40:07] <dyadic> sempf: for the  *560.* data files
[2013-01-14 20:40:11] <Ymgve> if 1 was prime you could factor a into a * 1
[2013-01-14 20:40:14] <iIIustrious> 560.00, .13 and .17
[2013-01-14 20:40:15] <Ymgve> and a * 1 * 1
[2013-01-14 20:40:19] <crash_demons> but then again, PM considers 0 prime too so...
[2013-01-14 20:40:29] <Ymgve> iIIustrious: don't forget a _ before 560.00
[2013-01-14 20:40:33] <Ymgve> for some reason
[2013-01-14 20:40:39] <crash_demons> Ymgve, why not?
[2013-01-14 20:40:40] <dyadic> 1 is usually not defined to be prime because that's a pita with other definitions :)
[2013-01-14 20:40:45] <dyadic> and proofs
[2013-01-14 20:40:47] <crash_demons> 1^inf = 1
[2013-01-14 20:40:54] <dyadic> Ymgve: yeah that's really odd
[2013-01-14 20:41:12] <Ymgve> crash_demons: it breaks the fact that numbers have one unique factorization
[2013-01-14 20:41:39] <dyadic> and you have to add special cases to handle that in all your proofs
[2013-01-14 20:41:54] <Lurker69> 560= 2*2*2*2*5*7
[2013-01-14 20:42:07] <Ymgve> but sure, you can decide that 1 is prime if you want to
[2013-01-14 20:42:21] <sempf> it screws some importing theory up though
[2013-01-14 20:42:39] <crash_demons> I'm definitely not saying you have to expand it infinitely, just that you can in maths if you want/need to
[2013-01-14 20:42:49] <sempf> i have a big sheet of paper about primes
[2013-01-14 20:42:59] <sempf> i could grab it if you are looking for something
[2013-01-14 20:43:02] <crash_demons> and oddly it does become necessary sometimes
[2013-01-14 20:43:03] <Lurker69> http://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php/560.html hmm
[2013-01-14 20:43:36] <sempf> intresting
[2013-01-14 20:44:17] <Ymgve> but I'm going with whoever's theory that it's 560 because it's 1 mod 13
[2013-01-14 20:44:24] <Ymgve> and -1 mod 17
[2013-01-14 20:44:34] <dyadic> also, anyone know what the *s and +s denote in primes in the count output yet?
[2013-01-14 20:44:48] <Lurker69> http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RhondaNumber.html
[2013-01-14 20:44:50] <Ymgve> dyadic: * means it's prime when the digits are reversed too
[2013-01-14 20:44:57] <Lurker69> do we have to look at base 12
[2013-01-14 20:44:59] <Ymgve> + means it's just prime as written
[2013-01-14 20:45:03] <Ymgve> Lurker69: no
[2013-01-14 20:45:37] <dyadic> Ymgve: I noticed the mod 13 thing but it seems too number theoryish to be relevant
[2013-01-14 20:46:10] <dyadic> I don't see them expecting us to apply eg chinese remainder theorem or something that would require more initiation
[2013-01-14 20:46:30] <Ymgve> they required factorization of large numbers last year
[2013-01-14 20:46:46] <iIIustrious> I still wonder what the Offset: 3301 and Offset: 0 mean in the console messages
[2013-01-14 20:46:49] <dyadic> that's following an algorithm by rote though, or using someone else's code (better)
[2013-01-14 20:46:56] <iIIustrious> but I'm off for a few
[2013-01-14 20:47:02] =-= iIIustrious is now known as iII|afk
[2013-01-14 20:47:04] <Ymgve> iIIustrious: start xoring at that offset
[2013-01-14 20:47:12] <dyadic> that's not the same as thinking about a more legit number theory problem imo
[2013-01-14 20:47:14] <Ymgve> works for the hint message and the wtitter
[2013-01-14 20:47:15] <iII|afk> trust me I've tried
[2013-01-14 20:49:21] <dyadic> could knocking mean just inputting crap into count?
[2013-01-14 20:49:39] <Ymgve> it could mean anything
[2013-01-14 20:49:43] <Ymgve> that's the sad thing
[2013-01-14 20:49:52] <soulseekah> what is "knocking" referred to in technology though?
[2013-01-14 20:49:56] <soulseekah> like "port knocking" is one
[2013-01-14 20:49:57] <dyadic> the precedence in count is fucking convoluted btw
[2013-01-14 20:50:00] <soulseekah> anything else?
[2013-01-14 20:50:09] <Ymgve> nothing
[2013-01-14 20:50:22] <dyadic> try 'count oeoeoeoeo' and then 'count eoeoeoeoe'
[2013-01-14 20:50:45] <dyadic> and count 'iaeo'
[2013-01-14 20:51:23] <dyadic> there seems to be no hierarchy of which gets evaluated first

The nymphs feed on root juice and have strong front legs for digging. In the final nymphal instar, they construct an exit tunnel to the surface and emerge. They then molt (shed their skins) on a nearby plant for the last time and emerge as adults. The abandoned exoskeleton remains, still clinging to the b

[2013-01-14 23:29:23] <Lurker69> we actually got few new guys in past two days
[2013-01-14 23:33:40] <PersonalKilljoy> looks like we have pretty nice audience
[2013-01-14 23:33:55] <Ymgve> but still stuck
[2013-01-14 23:34:15] <Ymgve> it's gonna be SUCH a simple thing
[2013-01-14 23:34:25] <sempf> yes
[2013-01-14 23:34:28] <sempf> it will
[2013-01-14 23:34:35] <sempf> since the easier it is
[2013-01-14 23:34:37] <sempf> the harder it gets
[2013-01-14 23:39:22] <sempf> does anyone know how the filesystem in a .iso file works?
[2013-01-14 23:39:36] <Ymgve> there's a standard
[2013-01-14 23:39:43] <Lurker69> PersonalKilljoy: not really but if you take in account that majority of us are from /b/ we are suprizingly cancer and faggot free
[2013-01-14 23:39:53] <Ymgve> but I'm pretty sure you won't find anything in the iso directly
[2013-01-14 23:40:03] <sempf> i rather think
[2013-01-14 23:40:06] <sempf> it is something
[2013-01-14 23:40:08] <Lurker69> but on every ten posts there is one that messages are intended for
[2013-01-14 23:40:10] <sempf> in the iso
[2013-01-14 23:40:19] <sempf> missing from the filesystem
[2013-01-14 23:40:22] <Lurker69> ISO is  same shit as files
[2013-01-14 23:40:22] <sempf> like gaps
[2013-01-14 23:40:27] <Ymgve> I think it will be something we have to do on onion1
[2013-01-14 23:40:29] <qwefasdf> anyone tried anything with the 16khz hum in the .mp3? "knock on the sky and listen to the sound." the frequency is pretty high
[2013-01-14 23:40:47] <Ymgve> qwefasdf: people have tried various things with no success
[2013-01-14 23:40:57] <Lurker69> some anon also plcad in #3301hackers pad that ISO is not suitable for xoring
[2013-01-14 23:41:06] <soulseekah> qwefasdf, installing gnuradio
[2013-01-14 23:41:15] <Lurker69> Ymgve is right
[2013-01-14 23:41:16] <PersonalKilljoy> i have gnuradio
[2013-01-14 23:41:20] <qwefasdf> because it is weird and the hint seems to be pointing at it. or it could just be a metaphor
[2013-01-14 23:41:26] <Lurker69> we didnt get enough from telnet thing
[2013-01-14 23:41:29] <PersonalKilljoy> but it's rather complicated thing
[2013-01-14 23:41:42] <soulseekah> PersonalKilljoy, then demodulate FM at 15.8khz bandwidth around 1khz
[2013-01-14 23:41:43] <rr645> I'm not sure it's so much a hint as it is a 'just change up the way you're thinking'
[2013-01-14 23:41:57] <Lurker69> we got only hint and hello, and they programmed the whole console for that, there must be something else
[2013-01-14 23:42:14] <Ymgve> there's the "get" command
[2013-01-14 23:42:20] <Lurker69> maybe command is  connected to "knock on the sky and listen"
[2013-01-14 23:42:28] <Lurker69> and to forest trees
[2013-01-14 23:42:31] <Ymgve> which we can use to retrieve the data behind hello and hint
[2013-01-14 23:43:32] <Lurker69> we used hello to get onion2 and we used hint to get forest
[2013-01-14 23:43:49] <Lurker69> then there are missingprimes
[2013-01-14 23:43:53] <Ymgve> then again, hello seems _to_ obvious
[2013-01-14 23:43:58] <vujalov> has anyone tried using something called 'binwalk'?
[2013-01-14 23:44:17] <Lurker69> hey what if we connect GEMATRIAM PRIMUS and miissing ptimes
[2013-01-14 23:44:24] <Lurker69> and then use output to xor
[2013-01-14 23:44:30] <sempf> we could
[2013-01-14 23:44:37] <terg> What role does the gematria and runes play? Have they already been used to solve a puzzle?
[2013-01-14 23:44:39] <Lurker69> wich runes are missing in missing primes
[2013-01-14 23:44:41] <sempf> but xor with what?
[2013-01-14 23:44:46] <Ymgve> well LOAD"$",8,1 is not a command
[2013-01-14 23:44:55] <Lurker69> xor with .17  and wisdom
[2013-01-14 23:44:59] <Ymgve> Lurker69: how
[2013-01-14 23:45:04] <Ymgve> terg: no
[2013-01-14 23:45:05] <sempf> to few information
[2013-01-14 23:45:07] <sempf> i think
[2013-01-14 23:45:35] <Ymgve> it has only been used to check that the "numbers" corresponding to the mp3 poem are primes
[2013-01-14 23:46:01] <Lurker69> change missing prime to rune-->change to Letter --> change to ASCII --->binary and XOR
[2013-01-14 23:46:55] <Grazza> lurker
[2013-01-14 23:47:00] <Grazza> change to letter
[2013-01-14 23:47:01] <Ymgve> problem is that a lot of missing primes are four digit
[2013-01-14 23:47:07] <Grazza> is hard
[2013-01-14 23:47:11] <Lurker69> GEMATRIA had trole to contain Outguess PGP with tro2 adress also

[2013-01-15 00:03:23] <sempf> hmmm
[2013-01-15 00:03:29] <dyadic> there are only 10 primes that are prime when digits reversed, and are missing from primes output
[2013-01-15 00:03:29] <Lurker69> yes twin primes, palindromes ,emirps and Rhonda Numbers  are special numbers we found  until now

[2013-01-15 00:16:23] <rr645> Hasn't there been a guest something bouncing around for a while?
[2013-01-15 00:16:23] <soulseekah> yeh I see
[2013-01-15 00:16:25] <Tech1_Phone> doesnt matter
[2013-01-15 00:16:30] <Tech1_Phone> the ip that is
[2013-01-15 00:16:43] <sempf> he is goober
[2013-01-15 00:16:45] <sempf> i think
[2013-01-15 00:16:50] <soulseekah> we did a lot with that 15k line of noise
[2013-01-15 00:17:04] <soulseekah> variable db may mean AM instead of FM
[2013-01-15 00:17:20] <Tech1_Phone> troll or no troll, we need to look into that
[2013-01-15 00:17:25] <soulseekah> however it's certainly of variable frequency, so FM is the first thing I suggest
[2013-01-15 00:17:30] <soulseekah> but still installing gnuradio
[2013-01-15 00:17:47] <Tech1_Phone> i doubt that was goober, didnt he ask was telnet was earlier?
[2013-01-15 00:17:56] <sempf> he has the same ip
[2013-01-15 00:18:04] <sempf> 4 users with the same ip
[2013-01-15 00:18:08] <Tech1_Phone> hm, didnt see that bit
[2013-01-15 00:18:28] <sempf> so yes
[2013-01-15 00:18:36] <sempf> he might be on a very different track than us
[2013-01-15 00:18:39] <sempf> or might just be trolling us
[2013-01-15 00:18:43] <sempf> or might be a hint
[2013-01-15 00:18:56] <soulseekah> 15.670 so exact
[2013-01-15 00:19:00] <Tech1_Phone> we need to eliminate the possibility that it was a troll
[2013-01-15 00:19:07] <soulseekah> center frequency is 15.8 though
[2013-01-15 00:19:09] <Tech1_Phone> isnt that correct soul?
[2013-01-15 00:19:14] <Tech1_Phone> ah
[2013-01-15 00:19:15] <soulseekah> 670 is lower bound I think
[2013-01-15 00:19:22] <sempf> are you right?
[2013-01-15 00:19:24] <Tech1_Phone> maybe he was counting up
[2013-01-15 00:19:26] <soulseekah> and 16600 upper
[2013-01-15 00:19:36] <soulseekah> shit, need gnuradio asap
[2013-01-15 00:19:39] <sempf> killjoy tested it and it was 15.6x as medium
[2013-01-15 00:19:56] <Tech1_Phone> any you isolate a freq with it soul?
[2013-01-15 00:20:04] <soulseekah> demodulate it
[2013-01-15 00:20:08] <Tech1_Phone> i'll jump back to my pc if it'll help
[2013-01-15 00:20:12] <soulseekah> the freq has been isolated countless of times
[2013-01-15 00:20:16] <Tech1_Phone> ah
[2013-01-15 00:20:23] <soulseekah> and all sorts of processing has been done on it
[2013-01-15 00:20:37] <funride> 15.6kHz seems to be the upper limit for standard mp3 as well...
[2013-01-15 00:20:44] <Tech1_Phone> screw sleep. im inc.

[2013-01-15 00:21:18] <sempf> could one of you guys light me up with my questions about some things that i cannot find where they have been used for
[2013-01-15 00:21:20] <sempf> if they have been used
[2013-01-15 00:21:28] <soulseekah> ye
[2013-01-15 00:22:08] <sempf> so did we learn anything from the cicada os?
[2013-01-15 00:22:11] <sempf> from booting it

[2013-01-15 00:23:01] <Vigs> Really curious
[2013-01-15 00:23:03] <sempf> we havent found an use for the missing primes did we
[2013-01-15 00:23:04] <Tech1> alright
[2013-01-15 00:23:09] <Tech1> i'm downloading
[2013-01-15 00:23:14] <sempf> and we havent found something for the runes
[2013-01-15 00:23:23] <Vigs> Can someone catch me up, I dont think i can be much help but i may be
[2013-01-15 00:23:24] <sempf> and no use for 560.17
[2013-01-15 00:23:26] <funride> thanks soul, I'm just googling 15.6khz and i see a lot of noise from tv etc.
[2013-01-15 00:24:00] <sempf> and the number 560 itself is also unused
[2013-01-15 00:24:08] <soulseekah> Vigs, read wiki in topic to briefly get acqauinted with wt we have so far
[2013-01-15 00:24:40] <soulseekah> that band has been bothering everyone since day 1
[2013-01-15 00:24:47] <Vigs> Cheers
[2013-01-15 00:25:02] <sempf> there is a 2nd way smaller band to btw
[2013-01-15 00:25:10] <Tech1> soulseekah: wnat to dropbox the isolated band?
[2013-01-15 00:25:12] <soulseekah> sempf, at wt freq?
[2013-01-15 00:25:19] <funride> I mean it IS a peak but it's still very low at ~-80dB, I'm really torn
[2013-01-15 00:25:20] <soulseekah> Tech1, not really
[2013-01-15 00:25:26] <Tech1> fair enough
[2013-01-15 00:25:32] <lulzorz> does it look like PSK-variant?
[2013-01-15 00:25:40] <vujalov> there is an lzma file in the mp3... so I tried to take it out and extract it but screwed up I think
[2013-01-15 00:25:42] <soulseekah> Tech1, did you mean you want to dropbox it?
[2013-01-15 00:25:55] <soulseekah> vujalov, ....is that so?
[2013-01-15 00:26:00] <lulzorz> vujalov: show us the code
[2013-01-15 00:26:02] <soulseekah> any particulars you can share with us?
[2013-01-15 00:26:09] <lulzorz> or the offsets, or whatever
[2013-01-15 00:26:51] <lulzorz> the thing about PSK is it's pretty much got a bandwidth of 0
[2013-01-15 00:27:03] <lulzorz> so it shows up the same as a pure tone on the spectro
[2013-01-15 00:27:15] <lulzorz> and sounds nearly pure as well
[2013-01-15 00:27:21] <Vigs> So what IS cicada?
[2013-01-15 00:27:27] <Vigs> A program? A person?
[2013-01-15 00:27:36] <soulseekah> PSK?
[2013-01-15 00:27:40] <lulzorz> a group, from the looks of it
[2013-01-15 00:27:45] <lulzorz> soulseekah: it's a radio thing...data in sound
[2013-01-15 00:27:47] <soulseekah> I thought least PSK was 31Hz
[2013-01-15 00:27:50] <soulseekah> bandwidth
[2013-01-15 00:27:56] <Vigs> What do they want?
[2013-01-15 00:27:58] <soulseekah> PSK-31
[2013-01-15 00:27:58] |<-- RikudoSennin has left freenode (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-01-15 00:28:19] <lulzorz> well, that depends on how you define bandwidth
[2013-01-15 00:28:23] <lulzorz> bitrate is something different
[2013-01-15 00:28:38] <lulzorz> bandwidth is the horizontal space it takes up on the waterfall
[2013-01-15 00:28:38] <soulseekah> the least and highest freq taken into account for phase shifts
[2013-01-15 00:28:43] <soulseekah> exactly
[2013-01-15 00:29:00] <soulseekah> there's a central frequency but it has edges
[2013-01-15 00:29:05] <lulzorz> and since in PSK, the pitch doesn't change, it's pretty much 0
[2013-01-15 00:29:15] <soulseekah> psk-31 allows for 31hz of freedom
[2013-01-15 00:29:20] <Kokosnuss> vigs: It looks like they support freedom of information
[2013-01-15 00:29:35] <Lurker69> i am off for few  keep that one alive
[2013-01-15 00:29:37] <Lurker69> https://boards.4chan.org/x/res/11811625#p11811696
[2013-01-15 00:29:42] <soulseekah> but yes, lulzorz you're quite right
[2013-01-15 00:29:50] <Vigs> Sorry i keep asking whats going on
[2013-01-15 00:29:54] <Lurker69> we still have this one http://boards.4chan.org/sci/res/5414358#p5427528
[2013-01-15 00:29:55] <lulzorz> so I guess, theoretically, it's a bandwidth of 0
[2013-01-15 00:29:57] <Vigs> I'm just intriuged
[2013-01-15 00:29:58] <lulzorz> but the shifts mess it up
[2013-01-15 00:30:01] <soulseekah> 1 though
[2013-01-15 00:30:21] <soulseekah> 1hz bandwidth = 1 freq. it can occupy

[2013-01-15 00:30:42] <lulzorz> kinda...frequency is a really weird thing
[2013-01-15 00:30:44] <Kokosnuss> Vigs: https://pastee.org/w65yc
[2013-01-15 00:30:49] <soulseekah> can't have 0, but whatever
[2013-01-15 00:30:59] <soulseekah> the fact is what matters
[2013-01-15 00:31:02] <sempf> soulseekah this bandwith
[2013-01-15 00:31:02] <sempf> http://i48.tinypic.com/2vdshti.jpg
[2013-01-15 00:31:08] <lulzorz> I would consider a pure tone to have a bandwidth of 0
[2013-01-15 00:31:11] <lulzorz> but yeah, whatever
[2013-01-15 00:31:24] <soulseekah> how so, it has 1 and exactly 1 frequency
[2013-01-15 00:31:30] <soulseekah> it's number, 44444444444444444444444444444444444444444444$AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[2013-01-15 00:31:46] <soulseekah> 440 A i meant, 1     freq
[2013-01-15 00:31:52] <soulseekah> shitty keyboard
[2013-01-15 00:32:07] <soulseekah> so A would have a bandwidth of exaclty 1 frequency

[2013-01-15 00:38:43] <qwefasdf> has anyone found the strange pattern in the amplified 16khz frequency?
[2013-01-15 00:38:46] <qwefasdf> almost like they form letters
[2013-01-15 00:38:47] <qwefasdf> they dont
[2013-01-15 00:38:48] <qwefasdf> but
[2013-01-15 00:38:50] <qwefasdf> its really strage
[2013-01-15 00:39:09] <Ymgve> show us
[2013-01-15 00:39:16] <Kokosnuss> Yea, I saw something like that about a week ago. Someone on here pointed it out
[2013-01-15 00:39:23] <Kokosnuss> Could it form rune shapes?
[2013-01-15 00:39:44] <qwefasdf> gimme a sec to upload it
[2013-01-15 00:40:25] <qwefasdf> hmmm
[2013-01-15 00:40:38] <qwefasdf> rune shapes do look interesting,but I'm not sure
[2013-01-15 00:41:12] * soulseekah still hopes it's an AM signal
[2013-01-15 00:41:29] <qwefasdf> http://i49.tinypic.com/34qwgf8.png
[2013-01-15 00:42:00] <Aloo> oh snap
[2013-01-15 00:42:05] <dyadic> are we getting repeatedly trolled with this :P
[2013-01-15 00:42:22] <soulseekah> :F
[2013-01-15 00:42:36] <soulseekah> that's bs it seems
[2013-01-15 00:42:41] <soulseekah> although possible
[2013-01-15 00:42:56] * soulseekah launching audacity...
[2013-01-15 00:43:01] <qwefasdf> why are they forming such strange shapes? I mean, they're made out of quantized bits of sound
[2013-01-15 00:43:13] <qwefasdf> unlike any other part of the sound
[2013-01-15 00:43:37] <Aloo> How did you set that up QewDasf?
[2013-01-15 00:43:46] <soulseekah> that looks like some digital encoding
[2013-01-15 00:43:55] <qwefasdf> just crank up the amplitude all the way up
[2013-01-15 00:43:57] <soulseekah> dyadic, u think troll?
[2013-01-15 00:44:30] <qwefasdf> isolating the higher frequencies and then increasing the amplitude gives the same result
[2013-01-15 00:44:44] <Aloo> How do you isolate?
[2013-01-15 00:44:54] <qwefasdf> set up a high pass filter
[2013-01-15 00:44:56] <soulseekah> i fucking see them
[2013-01-15 00:45:01] <qwefasdf> I set it to around 15khz
[2013-01-15 00:45:03] <Tech1> are you shitting me?
[2013-01-15 00:45:03] <soulseekah> Ymgve, what do you think?
[2013-01-15 00:45:06] <soulseekah> yes
[2013-01-15 00:45:08] <soulseekah> I see t hem
[2013-01-15 00:45:12] <Ymgve> not sure
[2013-01-15 00:45:16] <dyadic> soulseekah: not sure...they look to be sampled about 40 samples per second whatever they are
[2013-01-15 00:45:30] <Ymgve> what channel?
[2013-01-15 00:45:55] <dyadic> this could be artefact, again, either of the software or the original file
[2013-01-15 00:46:15] <qwefasdf> its a weird artefact
[2013-01-15 00:46:23] <qwefasdf> if it is one ^^
[2013-01-15 00:46:41] <soulseekah> http://www.anony.ws/i/2013/01/15/YkxVg.png
[2013-01-15 00:46:42] <Aloo> cut off frequency 15k?
[2013-01-15 00:46:46] <qwefasdf> yeah
[2013-01-15 00:46:49] <soulseekah> no need to cutoff
[2013-01-15 00:46:54] <soulseekah> I ust amplified all the way up
[2013-01-15 00:47:01] <soulseekah> 30+db allow clipping
[2013-01-15 00:47:11] <qwefasdf> yeah
[2013-01-15 00:47:54] <sempf> anyone intrested into comparing these to the runes?
[2013-01-15 00:48:04] <soulseekah> I think it's an artefact though
[2013-01-15 00:48:22] <sempf> is there any way we can isolate this in the file?
[2013-01-15 00:48:43] <sempf> this might be something hidden in the file
[2013-01-15 00:48:55] <sempf> it could also be it is something we already got from the file
[2013-01-15 00:48:56] <soulseekah> 2:38 looks like supermario

[2013-01-15 00:49:21] <soulseekah> now weird thing
[2013-01-15 00:49:27] <soulseekah> is tht this only is happening in second part
[2013-01-15 00:49:30] <Aloo> At around 2:00 is the most dense
[2013-01-15 00:49:31] <soulseekah> not the first one
[2013-01-15 00:49:33] <soulseekah> yes
[2013-01-15 00:49:42] <soulseekah> so it's not an artifact of the noise
[2013-01-15 00:49:47] <qwefasdf> what is happening in the 2nd part?
[2013-01-15 00:49:48] <soulseekah> as the noise goes througought
[2013-01-15 00:49:53] <dyadic> if it were something I would guess some kind of fsk
[2013-01-15 00:50:00] <sbrsbr> im not saying there might not be anything else there, but it'd be weird to find something else now, after the progress.
[2013-01-15 00:50:01] <dyadic> but I think it is just artefact
[2013-01-15 00:50:24] <sbrsbr> I mean, if there is something else, it should have been necessary before, i think
[2013-01-15 00:50:27] <sempf> couldnt it just be steno hidden in the mp3?
[2013-01-15 00:50:41] <soulseekah> gotta run this through that psk program
[2013-01-15 00:50:48] <soulseekah> fldigi
[2013-01-15 00:50:58] <soulseekah> although ti's not psk
[2013-01-15 00:50:59] <soulseekah> something else
[2013-01-15 00:51:03] <qwefasdf> perhaps by "you have everything" he just meant that we're supposed to figure out a way to extract information from it
[2013-01-15 00:51:30] <soulseekah> the appear at 16k-19k
[2013-01-15 00:52:25] <dyadic> still looks more like fsk to me, but also a nonsensical fsk where the bands are changing width and such
[2013-01-15 00:52:27] <Aloo> I get the main picture, just not as well as you guys.
[2013-01-15 00:52:45] <Absence_> has anyone tried using audiacity?

[2013-01-15 00:53:45] <soulseekah> very interesting
[2013-01-15 00:53:45] <qwefasdf> maybe the width change is caused by some random artefacts or something? there seems to be lots of info there

[2013-01-15 00:54:36] <dyadic> found music at mp3 artefacting :)
[2013-01-15 00:54:36] <terg> what about interval between notes in the music?
[2013-01-15 00:54:54] <soulseekah> Aloo, apply Amplify all the way up to 40-50

[2013-01-15 00:56:08] <qwefasdf> wait, so is the same artefacting found in other mp3s?
[2013-01-15 00:56:08] <soulseekah> Ymgve, meant amplitude-wise
[2013-01-15 00:56:17] <soulseekah> qwefasdf, let's go check

[2013-01-15 00:56:26] <qwefasdf> well I checked some
[2013-01-15 00:56:28] <qwefasdf> didn't find it
[2013-01-15 00:56:45] <qwefasdf> what mp3's did you use?
[2013-01-15 00:57:10] <soulseekah> Ymgve, also freq. wise - I have mp3s going to 22k
[2013-01-15 00:57:44] <Ymgve> huh
[2013-01-15 00:57:45] <funride> I can post a screen. Now I'm not saying there couldn't be anything, doesn't seem to be extremely unique though
[2013-01-15 00:57:55] <qwefasdf> post it
[2013-01-15 00:58:11] <soulseekah> meh I see those boxes

[2013-01-15 01:02:09] <dyadic> saying put that on the list, not calling you womens
[2013-01-15 01:02:22] <Aloo> needless to say, very low detail. Hard to even read. How would we increase the detail?
[2013-01-15 01:02:46] <sempf> the smallest prime bigger than the last prime of the list is 1229
[2013-01-15 01:03:08] <sempf> which is one of the prime factors of the number in the poem
[2013-01-15 01:03:15] <dyadic> there are only 10 emirps that were missing

[2013-01-15 01:08:59] <Ymgve> of course the oddness of the words could simply come from them struggling to find sentences that matched primes

[2013-01-15 01:38:47] <fasd> its funny that they would put it in quotes when they made it up, the entire phrase that is
[2013-01-15 01:39:37] <Ymgve> made up?
[2013-01-15 01:40:14] <qwefasdf> okay, so if I got this straight, the gematria primus image was constructed from the twitter posts and the count function just outputs the sum of the values of letters/groups of letters? did anyone connect the runes with something?
[2013-01-15 01:40:39] <Ymgve> nope, runes are unused
[2013-01-15 01:42:37] <qwefasdf> hm
[2013-01-15 01:42:54] <qwefasdf> and there are some missing primes? some primes that have a value in the rune table
[2013-01-15 01:43:27] <qwefasdf> I'm getting a couple of ideas
[2013-01-15 01:43:30] <Ymgve> yes but it's a contiguous chunk of primes
[2013-01-15 01:43:41] <Ymgve> which mostly include primes not in the rune table

[2013-01-15 08:48:12] <zebra> I was afk and I came back and saw it.
[2013-01-15 08:48:21] <cain1> ok
[2013-01-15 08:48:58] <wegoanonanon> They were "knocking on the sky" and pinging the 2nd onion... it sent back 2 responses per ping... that data was captured, decoded, and turned out to be a .tar with a text file containing the 3rd onion

[2013-01-15 09:16:53] <iIIustrious> Evening gents
[2013-01-15 09:17:16] <resonance> Hi
[2013-01-15 09:17:17] <cain1> hey
[2013-01-15 09:17:33] <PersonalKilljoy> hi
[2013-01-15 09:18:11] <PersonalKilljoy> but it wouldn't make much sense
[2013-01-15 09:18:25] <sempf1992> so what happened exactly last night
[2013-01-15 09:18:36] <PersonalKilljoy> if they are looking for some intelligent/highly skilled people
[2013-01-15 09:18:46] <sempf1992> after the crazyness about the 15.6 khz band
[2013-01-15 09:19:02] <PersonalKilljoy> then after the 3rd onion it could turn to intelligent/highly skilled people within okinawa district
[2013-01-15 09:19:15] <cain1> last year also they where coordinates, and in those coordinates they found out papers on the street
[2013-01-15 09:20:05] <testtest> why would the puzzle be posted on /b/ if they're looking for people in that district?
[2013-01-15 09:20:55] <testtest> on /x/ * (or wherever it was posted first)
[2013-01-15 09:21:00] <Cosmo_> What's so important about japan? why are the coordinates there?
[2013-01-15 09:21:25] <cain1> i dont think they are looking people in that district, just 1 person can get the message and post it here, or take a pic and upload it
[2013-01-15 09:21:25] <resonance> Why is there only 1 coordinate?
[2013-01-15 09:21:27] <testtest> random location? last time they were randomly spread all around the world
[2013-01-15 09:21:30] <PersonalKilljoy> it's not even a big island
[2013-01-15 09:21:35] <PersonalKilljoy> it's rather small
[2013-01-15 09:22:08] <PersonalKilljoy> or another possibility: they will post another coordinates
[2013-01-15 09:25:35] <Cosmo_> also are we sure someone actually needs to go there? Or there's something else about that point
[2013-01-15 09:26:22] <PersonalKilljoy> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawa_Island
[2013-01-15 09:27:02] <PersonalKilljoy> let's see: controversial US military bases, population of the longest-lived people in the world
[2013-01-15 09:27:24] <Cosmo_> Also it seems to be pointing AT a building
[2013-01-15 09:28:52] <cain1> in google street it look like pointing at a public lamppost
[2013-01-15 09:29:47] <Cosmo_> Well a building sounds more realistic if we're to be able to do something from here surely?

[2013-01-15 09:30:39] <Cosmo_> Yomitan bus terminal....maybe not
[2013-01-15 09:33:53] <PersonalKilljoy> and there are these weird concrete houses
[2013-01-15 09:33:59] <PersonalKilljoy> that looks like abandoned
[2013-01-15 09:35:47] <Cosmo_> I like the giant shiny water container looking thing

[2013-01-15 09:56:00] <Cosmo_> We're all on holiday in okinawa
[2013-01-15 09:56:21] <zebra> There were no more posted?
[2013-01-15 09:57:02] <Cosmo_> I wasn't paying a lot of attention so someone else will be able to explain, but as far as i know, some guy posted on /x/ about pings, black magic happened, and we ended up with a third onion
[2013-01-15 09:57:28] <zebra> Ya I know I was here, I was just curious if anything new happened.
[2013-01-15 09:57:42] <Cosmo_> Nope
[2013-01-15 09:57:43] <zebra> Hopefully there will be more then just the 1.
[2013-01-15 09:58:38] <zebra> It says page last edited on the 12th, is this an old onion that we missed?

[2013-01-15 09:59:43] <alsk> still nothing on knocking the sky?
[2013-01-15 09:59:51] <zebra> ... I wonder who posted on /x/ also, he must be ahead of us.
[2013-01-15 10:00:06] <zebra> Maybe theres a different irc with ppl working on it.
[2013-01-15 10:00:09] <iIIustrious> well, not anymore unless he lives in oki
[2013-01-15 10:00:51] <iIIustrious> in this sort of thing, it's more likely there's guys who are watching us and the wiki, and just using our work, than an entire other group we've never heard of
[2013-01-15 10:01:34] <zebra> That makes sense, it just seems unlikely that 1 person managed to get something that a group didnt.
[2013-01-15 10:02:56] <iIIustrious> not in this case
[2013-01-15 10:03:09] <iIIustrious> this time, it ended up that we were over complicating things vastly
[2013-01-15 10:03:26] <iIIustrious> which is easier to do when you can assume someone else in the group has taken the low hanging fruit
[2013-01-15 10:03:44] <zebra> I see
[2013-01-15 10:04:03] <zebra> So the last clue we're waiting on is in okinawa?
[2013-01-15 10:04:10] <iIIustrious> for right now
[2013-01-15 10:04:23] <iIIustrious> given the structure of that page, I'm willing to bet more coords get added
[2013-01-15 10:04:29] <zebra> Well hopefully more coord's will be added.
[2013-01-15 10:04:32] <iIIustrious> it seems to be starting a list forma
[2013-01-15 10:04:32] <iIIustrious> t
[2013-01-15 10:04:35] <zebra> It still says stand by
[2013-01-15 10:04:53] <iIIustrious> that I think was the first message
[2013-01-15 10:04:54] <zebra> Ya and if they weren't going to add more, they wouldn't keep stand by for coordinates on the page.
[2013-01-15 10:04:59] <iIIustrious> then they dropped the first coords
[2013-01-15 10:05:07] <iIIustrious> like I said, it looks like they're making a list
[2013-01-15 10:05:32] <zebra> If there is a coord near me Ill go to it. I kinda hope I get one here.
[2013-01-15 10:05:45] <Cosmo_> If one's in the UK in the next 6 days i can put my rail card to good use.

[2013-01-15 10:53:42] <Ymgve> did they ping thru tor or what
[2013-01-15 10:53:53] <iIIustrious> no, the linode address
[2013-01-15 10:54:04] <sempf> we should check on the onion if it updates
[2013-01-15 10:54:13] <iIIustrious> I've got it refreshing
[2013-01-15 10:54:46] <sempf> if someone takes the note without telling the rest
[2013-01-15 10:54:47] <Ymgve> I gotta say that was a stupid fucking solution tho
[2013-01-15 10:54:49] <sempf> we might notice it from the onion
[2013-01-15 10:54:56] <iIIustrious> lol

[2013-01-15 11:00:32] <iIIustrious> some people needed to bypass their router

[2013-01-15 14:15:08] <sempf> i just checked the page source
[2013-01-15 14:15:14] <sempf> it does have the welcome on the source
[2013-01-15 14:15:19] <sempf> but on the page i view
[2013-01-15 14:15:22] <sempf> there is no
[2013-01-15 14:15:31] <primius> it depends on timing
[2013-01-15 14:15:37] <funride> can't get the complete message from the pings, it skips the 1st, 3rd, ... lines
[2013-01-15 14:15:39] <primius> the browser refetches when you view source
[2013-01-15 14:15:52] <primius> funride: lines or packets?
[2013-01-15 14:16:21] <funride> the lines of the resulting file, it always sends 56 bytes
[2013-01-15 14:16:32] <primius> hmmm...weird
[2013-01-15 14:16:39] <soulseekah> funride, what are you dumping with?
[2013-01-15 14:16:46] <funride> tcpdump
[2013-01-15 14:16:49] <primius> I don't have a connection where I can verify any of this
[2013-01-15 14:16:56] <primius> but the pgp checks out, so whatever
[2013-01-15 14:17:22] <funride> so I only get half the file and then it repeats again from 0x49...
[2013-01-15 14:17:34] <soulseekah> funride, make sure you have enough buffering
[2013-01-15 14:17:42] <soulseekah> add -s0 perhaps
[2013-01-15 14:17:44] <funride> I set it to -s0
[2013-01-15 14:18:13] <soulseekah> the start of the file is 1f8b0808
[2013-01-15 14:18:34] <soulseekah> 49 is the next line
[2013-01-15 14:18:40] <funride> yes, but "my" first packet is 49b3aa..
[2013-01-15 14:18:51] <funride> after the last one, which is 44 bytes
[2013-01-15 14:18:53] <soulseekah> they repeat over and over again
[2013-01-15 14:18:55] <sempf> hmmm
[2013-01-15 14:19:03] <sempf> how do you telnet into that onion?
[2013-01-15 14:19:07] <funride> eh, whatever, doesn't matter much anyway lael
[2013-01-15 14:19:09] <soulseekah> 28 lines in total funride
[2013-01-15 14:19:20] <sempf> just find the right ip?
[2013-01-15 14:19:20] <soulseekah> you never get the first line necessarily
[2013-01-15 14:19:36] <soulseekah> so you wait until you find a cycle
[2013-01-15 14:19:40] <funride> 14 repeating here
[2013-01-15 14:19:51] <soulseekah> funride, pinging with a high speed?
[2013-01-15 14:19:59] <funride> after the last 44byte packet it starts with 0x49b3aa again
[2013-01-15 14:20:03] <soulseekah> set interval to less maybe
[2013-01-15 14:20:13] <soulseekah> weird
[2013-01-15 14:20:15] <funride> how many secons
[2013-01-15 14:20:16] <funride> d
[2013-01-15 14:20:26] <soulseekah> I use default setting works fine
[2013-01-15 14:20:28] <funride> also, how slow is that server? lol
[2013-01-15 14:20:32] <soulseekah> try 2 seconds
[2013-01-15 14:20:41] <soulseekah> maybe htey're not reaching you in time while being routed
[2013-01-15 14:20:45] <soulseekah> in sequence, i mean
[2013-01-15 14:20:46] <funride> I'll have a look
[2013-01-15 14:20:56] <resonance_> do you want the link to the packet capture?
[2013-01-15 14:20:59] <soulseekah> one comes before another, etc.
[2013-01-15 14:21:00] <sempf> maybe slowdown from a lot of people pinging it
[2013-01-15 14:21:06] <resonance_> it was posted earlier
[2013-01-15 14:21:07] <funride> maybe
[2013-01-15 14:21:11] <primius> sempf: nah, linode is fast
[2013-01-15 14:21:20] <primius> and there are <10 people pinging
[2013-01-15 14:21:27] <funride> but it's weird that it's so regular, i.e. every 2nd line
[2013-01-15 14:21:28] <soulseekah> the data is both in the topic an the wiki
[2013-01-15 14:21:37] <primius> unless someone is trying to fuck with our clues
[2013-01-15 14:21:42] * primius glares into the darkness
[2013-01-15 14:21:43] <soulseekah> funride, so you're missing every second ping response?
[2013-01-15 14:22:09] <sempf> do you need to use telnet over tor?
[2013-01-15 14:22:11] <soulseekah> looks like a synchronization issue too me, is the ping higher than 1 second?
[2013-01-15 14:22:13] <soulseekah> sempf, yes
[2013-01-15 14:22:14] <funride> no, every request is replied to, but only every second line
[2013-01-15 14:22:23] <funride> no it's ~0.3s
[2013-01-15 14:22:26] <soulseekah> hmm
[2013-01-15 14:22:45] <soulseekah> so you're missing every 2nd out of band response (with seq 1)
[2013-01-15 14:22:48] <sempf> ok then my programm cant use telnet
[2013-01-15 14:22:55] <funride> that's it
[2013-01-15 14:23:01] <soulseekah> try another server
[2013-01-15 14:23:19] <sempf> i just downloaded the top link
[2013-01-15 14:23:19] <soulseekah> ISP may be cutting every second out of band icmp packet
[2013-01-15 14:23:20] <sempf> putty.exe
[2013-01-15 14:23:31] <soulseekah> my ISP stops all responses, fucking dicks
[2013-01-15 14:24:13] <funride> doesn't make sense, though, does it? I get the first (regular) reply, then the payload, then the next request, regular, next payload -> skipped a line
[2013-01-15 14:24:47] <soulseekah> wait
[2013-01-15 14:25:02] <soulseekah> so you're not getting a skipped 2nd out of band response
[2013-01-15 14:25:10] <soulseekah> you're getting an out of band response every time
[2013-01-15 14:25:14] <soulseekah> just the data seems skipped
[2013-01-15 14:25:16] <funride> no I get the payload but only every 2nd line
[2013-01-15 14:25:20] <funride> yes
[2013-01-15 14:25:23] <soulseekah> I see
[2013-01-15 14:25:36] <soulseekah> let me try again
[2013-01-15 14:25:50] <soulseekah> maybe >1 people pinging at the same time causes losses
[2013-01-15 14:26:02] <soulseekah> as the icmp responder is setup to echo a line per ping request
[2013-01-15 14:26:12] <soulseekah> and when two pinging parties are doing it they get one line each
[2013-01-15 14:26:27] <soulseekah> I was pinging it by the way
[2013-01-15 14:26:28] <funride> that would be bad, but at least you got the whole file
[2013-01-15 14:26:29] <soulseekah> try now

[2013-01-15 14:26:57] <funride> runnan
[2013-01-15 14:27:36] <soulseekah> i think that the icmp responder just reads out each line regardless to who's getting it
[2013-01-15 14:27:59] <soulseekah> one by one, so two people pinging would get half the data each
[2013-01-15 14:28:24] <sempf> when i try to telnet in i get: error: connection not allowed by ruleset

[2013-01-15 15:28:46] <VBFH> maybe you already know this, but in the village at the coordinates was an american military base, "Senaha Communications Station, Yomitan, Okinawa (returned to the Japanese government in September 2006)"

[2013-01-15 15:49:49] <Lurker69> i am thinking if reason for tor2 beaing down is because they were preparigng the drop
[2013-01-15 15:50:26] <Tech1> That woul make sense.
[2013-01-15 15:50:37] <Lurker69> i didnt gzip the first message jet to check when mesage to access the tor3 was signed

[2013-01-15 15:51:55] <Lurker69> i didnt, but it would be hard to put drop there before google car drive by

[2013-01-15 15:53:05] <Lurker69> do i need to download rzip to unzip the gzip hexdump?
[2013-01-15 15:53:36] <funride> I don't know, I use 7z

[2013-01-15 15:54:20] <fasd> does any one here have weeaboo friends that live in japan?
[2013-01-15 15:54:28] <Lurker69> or maybe i compile it wrongly
[2013-01-15 15:54:31] <funride> rename it to gz
[2013-01-15 15:55:17] <funride> should be irrelevant though because extensions don't matter much

[2013-01-15 16:34:02] <funride> dude, even the jap could write better english
[2013-01-15 16:34:03] <Lurker69> is hex dump of ICMP pingin here correct?
[2013-01-15 16:34:05] <Lurker69> http://uncovering-cicada.wikia.com/wiki/TOR_2_ver_2_back_ONLINE
[2013-01-15 16:34:09] <soulseekah|null> yes
[2013-01-15 16:34:11] <soulseekah|null> I wrote that
[2013-01-15 16:34:34] <Lurker69> ok, i just need to put in hex editoe and save, rigt?
[2013-01-15 16:34:39] <sr01> knock on the sky and listen to the sound.
[2013-01-15 16:34:39] <funride> yes
[2013-01-15 16:34:46] <Lurker69> because xlate and notepad++ didnt work
[2013-01-15 16:34:56] <soulseekah|null> Lurker69, convert to binary, and gunzip
[2013-01-15 16:35:12] <soulseekah|null> xxd -r pc | gunzip
[2013-01-15 16:35:17] <soulseekah|null> err -pc
[2013-01-15 16:35:39] <soulseekah|null> it's gzipped data
[2013-01-15 16:35:41] <funride> he's on win
[2013-01-15 16:35:43] <funride> I think
[2013-01-15 16:36:00] <soulseekah|null> so convert to binary, save with .gz extension and use your archive manger
[2013-01-15 16:36:30] <Lurker69> soulseekah|null: yes but my firs try faile...
[2013-01-15 16:36:46] <Lurker69> in theory it should work by  converting with xlate  http://home.paulschou.net/tools/xlate/
[2013-01-15 16:36:52] <funride> be sure to paste it in the hex field, not the ascii field
[2013-01-15 16:37:06] <Lurker69> and coppin ascii to any halfdecent text editor
[2013-01-15 16:37:24] <soulseekah|null> I wouldn't count on that working
[2013-01-15 16:37:37] <soulseekah|null> let me send you the binary

[2013-01-15 20:04:50] <sempf> well
[2013-01-15 20:04:53] <Aloo> Or we fuck up his life
[2013-01-15 20:04:54] <sempf> send him to look wrong
[2013-01-15 20:05:04] <sempf> we anyways fuck up peoples lifes
[2013-01-15 20:05:09] <sr03> no, we gave the coordinates
[2013-01-15 20:05:10] <sempf> intended or unintended

[2013-01-15 20:06:01] <sempf> cant the be 10 metress of
[2013-01-15 20:06:10] <sr03> he could go after us all, like bourne did
[2013-01-15 20:06:22] <dan_> at that point there is a pole perfect for stapling things to
[2013-01-15 20:06:22] <sr03> yes the coordinates could be a bit off
[2013-01-15 20:06:31] <Aloo> Okay, if it's a restaurant, you ask them about their menu. And then move on to the QR
[2013-01-15 20:06:32] <sempf> brb going on tor
[2013-01-15 20:06:33] <sr03> but the poster should be visible anyway

[2013-01-15 20:07:29] <sempf> i took 1 sec work
[2013-01-15 20:07:46] <sempf> maybe we should send someone to follow the first guy

[2013-01-15 22:26:02] <iIIustrious> Zebra, if I were calling I'd suggest the same thing
[2013-01-15 22:26:07] <qwefasdf_> I mean, it seems that all information is being shared
[2013-01-15 22:26:11] <soulseekah> qwefasdf_, nearing the end nobody will share anything
[2013-01-15 22:26:14] <Aloo> Eventually, we'll get to a bottle neck where they'll tell us to do things by ourselves
[2013-01-15 22:26:20] <qwefasdf_> how do you know when we're near the end?
[2013-01-15 22:26:21] <soulseekah> we will help one another until the end is near
[2013-01-15 22:26:36] <Aloo> Its usually a little after the coordinates because we need to work toegther for that
[2013-01-15 22:26:39] <iIIustrious> They told us last year when to stop doing it as a team
[2013-01-15 22:26:40] <soulseekah> we generally people are one step ahead
[2013-01-15 22:26:45] <soulseekah> and know what they can share
[2013-01-15 22:26:50] <soulseekah> when they reach the end they'll know its the end
[2013-01-15 22:26:53] <soulseekah> and won't share shit
[2013-01-15 22:27:06] <sr01> true
[2013-01-15 22:27:50] <qwefasdf_> so by collectively solving the puzzle, you're just making cicada make up more riddles, because, when you get to the end, you're all gonna play just for yourself
[2013-01-15 22:28:00] <soulseekah> most probably
[2013-01-15 22:28:04] <iIIustrious> I find it strange that the have pieces you have to work together on, then tell you to stop. It seems counter intuitive
[2013-01-15 22:28:15] <soulseekah> Google always makes only one puzzle
[2013-01-15 22:28:20] <qwefasdf_> if everyone solved for himself, puzzles would probably be shorter

[2013-01-16 00:01:07] <sempf1992> we are the public
[2013-01-16 00:01:11] <Lurker69> zebra: i am constantly checking google and shit and i didnt found any other groups beside one linked in wiki, "other groups page" and all that groups are actually feeding on us
[2013-01-16 00:01:15] <sempf1992> like the academic world

[2013-01-16 00:15:27] <zebra> That would suck if they demand that.
[2013-01-16 00:15:29] <rr645> We haven't been massively trolled yet. There's no coherent competition…probably. I think we should, but if information ever becomes secretive or work has to be alone, we've got to close up shop quick.

[2013-01-16 01:09:45] <lulzorz> and put on in my house too
[2013-01-16 01:09:46] <sr01> just build an antenna
[2013-01-16 01:09:51] <lulzorz> and steal their net
[2013-01-16 01:09:56] <lulzorz> total cost $200

[2013-01-16 01:13:10] <sempf1992> i dunno
[2013-01-16 01:13:15] <sempf1992> i guess so

[2013-01-16 01:13:36] <sempf1992> so it is likely based on a linux distro

[2013-01-16 04:18:49] * lulzorz was under the impression it was damn near impossible to OD on MDMA
[2013-01-16 04:18:53] <bakpak2hvy> ILL BE CAREFULL IF I FEEL  LIKE IT
[2013-01-16 04:19:09] <dyadic> you can od on practically anything
[2013-01-16 04:19:18] <lulzorz> except weed
[2013-01-16 04:19:19] <lulzorz> lol
[2013-01-16 04:19:32] <dyadic> toxicity is all about amount/concentration
[2013-01-16 04:19:32] <Lurker69> lulzorz: it is impossible, but you can drink to much watter and your brains swaalow and you die because of pressure in brain
[2013-01-16 04:19:58] <Lurker69> you kall in coma and becaues of pressure youd breathing center can mulfinction
[2013-01-16 04:20:00] <bakpak2hvy> lol overdose on water
[2013-01-16 04:20:03] <lulzorz> Lurker69: I don't know what a "swaalow" is, but I'll be careful, thanks
[2013-01-16 04:20:12] <Lurker69> second way to die on mdma is heat shock
[2013-01-16 04:21:12] <Lurker69> swelling
[2013-01-16 04:21:29] <Lurker69> but for both of those reasons you have to be pretty stupid

[2013-01-16 04:48:40] <Kelgand> So when the business near the second drop was called, did the caller say, "Hello, I'm from the internet."? Please tell me they did.
[2013-01-16 04:48:44] <Lurker69> was never in its forum though but those sketches are nice
[2013-01-16 04:49:23] <crash_demons> I think I'm too stupid to understand that xkcd. or work drained the logical thought out of me.
[2013-01-16 04:49:49] <dyadic> 7*5*2 = 70
[2013-01-16 04:49:57] <dyadic> prime factorization of 70
[2013-01-16 04:50:10] <crash_demons> I got that, but the package is irrelevant?
[2013-01-16 04:50:24] <dyadic> who knows
[2013-01-16 04:50:33] <dyadic> not a fan of xkcd
[2013-01-16 04:50:45] <Kelgand> The package is a bomb, that's all.
[2013-01-16 04:51:17] <crash_demons> now here's a joke:   7.    7 and package (!).    boom.   Factorial.
[2013-01-16 04:51:33] <Kelgand> The 70 was "blown to pieces", the pieces being it's factors (instead of an arm or leg or something)
[2013-01-16 04:51:38] <crash_demons> meh :p
[2013-01-16 04:51:46] <dyadic> indeed
[2013-01-16 04:51:51] <Lurker69> that "i am fro mthe internet" needs to be donr at every ARG call
[2013-01-16 04:52:03] <crash_demons> most of their others are deeper than that
[2013-01-16 04:52:05] <nadando> isn't "i am from the internet" an xkcd thing
[2013-01-16 04:52:10] <dyadic> speak plural too
[2013-01-16 04:52:11] <Kelgand> That it is.
[2013-01-16 04:52:18] <dyadic> "we come from the internet"

[2013-01-16 04:52:38] <lulzorz> "we're from the internet" was sort of a geohashing slogan

[2013-01-16 08:31:09] <soulseekah> one of the businesses said that he saw it up on the weekend
[2013-01-16 08:31:18] <soulseekah> but it was no longer there afterwards
[2013-01-16 08:31:39] <D90> So, there was a piece of paper ?
[2013-01-16 08:32:03] <soulseekah> a poster of sorts, yes
[2013-01-16 08:32:25] <D90> Hmm, too bad it wasn't there anymore. Need more luck at the Japan location

[2013-01-16 08:35:07] <soulseekah> certainly this is not the only group working on this all
[2013-01-16 08:35:20] <D90> we are lacking behind then.
[2013-01-16 08:35:42] <soulseekah> could be, coordinates have been posted yesterday though
[2013-01-16 08:35:52] <soulseekah> and we started calling straight away
[2013-01-16 08:36:00] <soulseekah> maybe coordinates can be retrieved in another way
[2013-01-16 08:36:11] <D90> maybe,
