[2013-01-06 07:47:17] <leakshmskill_> alright
[2013-01-06 07:47:23] <leakshmskill_> it isn't hex

[2013-01-06 07:47:53] <Anon404_> no but it only contains numbers 0-9 and a-f, just like hex
[2013-01-06 07:48:05] <Anon404_> it can be a series of numbers, but it is not text

[2013-01-06 07:51:52] <lolxD> do you guys really work on this?
[2013-01-06 07:51:55] <Anon404__> I tried to convert a whole message to a number, it crashed
[2013-01-06 07:52:05] <leakshmskill_> hex translations make gibberish

[2013-01-06 07:53:12] <bakpak2hvy> it was 464 or something
[2013-01-06 07:53:16] <bakpak2hvy> dont remember exactly
[2013-01-06 07:53:28] <bakpak2hvy> it was the number of primes from the boot sequence
[2013-01-06 07:53:53] <leakshmskill_> it is at 260 or so
[2013-01-06 07:54:02] <leakshmskill_> 264
[2013-01-06 07:54:17] <bakpak2hvy> 266
[2013-01-06 07:54:29] <lolxD> guys, is "A" and "a" makes difference on hex code?
[2013-01-06 07:54:39] <bakpak2hvy> i think so
[2013-01-06 07:54:44] <lolxD> or the hex only use the "a" ?

[2013-01-06 07:56:11] <Anon404__> hex=base 16, upper/lower have no importance to my understanding (Im learning on the spot)
[2013-01-06 07:56:39] <crash_demons> correct
[2013-01-06 07:57:13] <leakshmskill_> is there anything significant about the name of the account?
[2013-01-06 07:58:11] <scrounger> no difference in capitalization in hex
[2013-01-06 07:58:12] <scrounger> hex is just base 16...
[2013-01-06 07:58:33] <leakshmskill_> anyone know html?
[2013-01-06 07:58:40] <leakshmskill_> last words of wisdom from rrr
[2013-01-06 07:58:42] <leakshmskill_> the tweets can be converted from hex to binary. When coded from binary to normal text they produce html codes. w/e you do with them, your call

[2013-01-06 08:33:53] <Kenodox> i think that it is because it takes so long to figure codes out, so they are all working, not posting the results becuase tehre are none yet
[2013-01-06 08:34:23] <Anon404> I am going to tell you which numbers in the Mertens function give 0 and are prime

[2013-01-06 08:48:33] <Anon404> I chose the Mertens function since one of the few specifics wikipedia had to say about 65 was that it returned 0 if used in the Mertens function, I then googled all numbers who return 0 through this function and kept only the primes since another clue was showing a list of prime numbers
